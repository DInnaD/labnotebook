 * [Dynamic manuscript](https://github.com/ropensci/treeBASE/tree/master/inst/doc/treebase).  Reorganize, simplify?
 * add, document, employ the additional functions to avoid `sapply` commands.
 * Prune examples?
 * iEvoBio challenge entry?

## [Wrightscape](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape)

 * Start synthesizing documents
 * [Evidence for release in open lever ratio and kt](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/master/inst/examples/manuscript.md)
 * [Illustrating the different models](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/master/inst/examples/simulate_release.md)
 * Consider updated data format outputs and graphical processing functions for the model choice steps

## [fishbase](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase)
