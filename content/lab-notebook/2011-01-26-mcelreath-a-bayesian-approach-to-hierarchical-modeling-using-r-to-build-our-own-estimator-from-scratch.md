[McElreath](http://xcelab.net/rm/) discusses (slides):



	
  * Bayes Theorem


$$ P(\theta | D) = \frac{Pr(D|\theta) Pr(\theta )}{Pr(D)} $$

	
  * Philosophy of Priors, Uninformative Priors



	
  * Confidence intervals / credible intervals for free



	
  * Computing the posterior: Directly or by MCMC


Nice visual example of updating prior as we add data:

  * King Markov and the chain islands.



	
  * Evaluating: Burn in , autocorrelation.Â  Thinning (saves memory).

	
  * Metropolis2.R bad mixing.

	
  * Compare better and worse proposal mechanisms, motivates Gibbs Sampling: propose from the posterior, always accepted.
