Finished up my SICB presentation tweaks, slides now up on slideshare, flying off to the conference tomorrow.  Created this in OpenOffice, started adding animations and then decided it would be more reliable to just duplicate slides to have parts appear (really just for the explanation of the likelihood ratio distributions under each model).  Next time think I'll stick with my usual inkscape slides tied together with latex beamer, the lack of vector images in this one is not ideal.  Presenting at 8am Tuesday in: [Macroevolution I - Methods and Character Evolution.](http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2011/schedule/results.php3?search=sday+%3D+%272011-01-04%27+AND+%28abstracts2011.sessionnumber+NOT+LIKE+%27S%25%27%29+AND+%28abstracts2011.sessionnumber+NOT+LIKE+%27P%25%27%29%29)

It's been another day of multiple projects:  I'm also running a few extra adaptive dynamics simulations to replicate the pattern of differences between phase 2 and phase 3 collapses from the May 5th simulations, and lastly, some work on the intro for the warning signals manuscript.
