<div id="agenda" class="section level2">
<h2>Agenda</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goal</li>
<li>Who &amp; what we have</li>
<li>imagine and design the hub</li>
<li>engage, govern, sustain</li>
<li>structure a proposal</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="nsf-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>NSF overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>What does NSF mean by hub? Consortium/network with regional focus</li>
<li>why regional? face time. regional issues</li>
<li>NSF thinking it will fund for 9-10 years (in 3 phases). next phase will be &lt; 3 years after first</li>
<li>phase 1: hub (executive director)</li>
<li>phase 2: spokes (priority areas)</li>
<li>phase 3: nodes (sustaining partner organizations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Volunteer steering council advises ED, executive staff partner organizations (beyond steering council) (model like the CRA)</p>
<p>Foundational Research example: Berkeley AMPlab (NSF, DARPA, DOE, AWS, Google, SAP) -&gt; apache open source: spark, mesos, tachyon</p>
<p>Education example: Schmidt family foundation funds U Chicago run Data Science for Social Good</p>
<p>Applications: Healthcare: industry using open clinicaltrials.gov data, tidy up/visual interface (Novartis, Pfizer, Eli Lillu)</p>
<p>NSF will fund the logistics, not the research (other NSF programs do that)</p>
<p>networking (meeting, staff) dynamic: grow over time Collaboration rather than competition: NSF prefers one proposal per region!! Must represent the entire region. West is the largest geographic region.</p>
<p>spokes can be regional areas as well as topical.</p>
<p>phase 1 somewhat of a planning grant</p>

<div id="charratte-outcome-goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Charratte outcome goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>priority applications</li>
<li>technical or research topics</li>
<li>societal big data issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Volunteer to organize next steps in coalescing regional stakeholders and advancing the region’s proposal</p>
<p>How will hubs interact? 2.5 day workshop at DC will talk about that after regionally focused hubs are created. Successful pilot (e.g. education) can spread nationally.</p>
<p>Coordination between federal agencies.</p>
<p>this group selected based on their white papers.</p>
<p>Networking</p>
<p>Content for the proposal from the western region</p>
<p>by hands, looks like 50% academic, 50% govt/non-profit (6)/for profit (6) in equal bit</p>
<hr />
<p>table breakout. environmental science strong at my table:</p>
<p>Mark Tompkins (Berkeley industry), Anne Wilson (Colorado), Jeremy Franklin, Philip Tarrant</p>
<p>Brainstorm 2: listing</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing hubs and partnerships</li>
<li>Data Sources</li>
<li>Analysis Capabilities</li>
<li>User and Uses</li>
<li>Education &amp; workforce development</li>
</ul>
<p>Breakout 2: Services the hub can provide</p>
<p>see our sticky. i make case for demographic diversity (&amp; geographic)</p>
<hr />
<p>plenary</p>
<p>staff, workshops. Not funding for infrastructure, not funding research, not funding education.</p>
<p>Could fund a workshop to create an NSF call for infrastructure.</p>
<p>structure: could rotate between campuses. could be led by a .org.</p>
<p>(us-ignite.org spun off. hub could spin off into a .org)</p>
<hr />
<p>Breakout 3: discuss very different images for what hub would look like</p>
<p>To encourage diversity of approaches, rooms were given different metaphors:</p>
<p>how could the hub be like a:</p>
<ul>
<li>weather</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals: foster research; education Matchmaking. tools + domains + data Standards. data trust. metadata. Buisness services: data management. sustainability Functions: workshops. events/hackathons. forum for curriculum development. data carpentry boot camps. standardization, containers. Governance: rotating board, transition to member funded</p>
<ul>
<li>brain</li>
</ul>
<p>body does the work.<br />
Facilitate communication. Directory of resources. Advocacy of best practices they must come to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>building</li>
</ul>
<p>modular diversity values: openness, collaboration, equality, agile built on existing infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li>ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>larger purpose/values. activities: student fellows, matchmaking, workshops spokes: natural resources, ag, natural hazards, healthcare, transportation leadership: ED. 18 person steering committee. spoke working groups Select steering committee: via an interim steering committee from the proposal.</p>
<p>Feedback: plus, potential, critique,</p>
<hr />
<p>Take volunteers for co pis (google doc)</p>
<p>Take volunteers for host institution (5 volunteer: UCSD Supercomputing Center, USC (ISI), UC Berkeley (BIDS), Federation for Earth Systems, state of Utah)</p>
<p>host institution volunteers meet to select host. Agreement by consensus on Federation for Earth Systems.</p>
<hr />
<p>Following further discussion with NSF, FES agrees to a UCSD-UCB-UW led.</p>
