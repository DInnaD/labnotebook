* Finish updates to socialR and wrote post.

	
  * reply to Richard on DataONE workflow internship

	
  * really should meet [Bertram](https://sites.google.com/site/ludaesch/), re: workflow, dataONE, open science, etc.

	
  * wrote an avereps fn to replace limma dependency.  hmmf.

	
  * setup analysis.R to run complete analysis sets.  still testing.





## To Do





	
  * consider returning myCall information on most standard functions

	
  * Review model implementations

	
  * model convergence error handling.

	
  * better handling than remove_uncoverged on mc plots.

	
  * uncoupled mcmc



	
  * make sure we can do non-timeseries objects. violates autocor, oh well, can have option to process.



	
  * consider adding runtime to socialR reporting. -- DONE, could use more testing.
