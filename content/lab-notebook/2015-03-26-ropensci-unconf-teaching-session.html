<div id="panel-on-effective-teaching-with-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Panel on Effective teaching with R</h2>
<p>Panel:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tracy Teal - Data Carpentry</li>
<li>Hadley Wickhan - undergrads at Rice, R master classes for RStudio</li>
<li>Mine, Prof Stats, Duke, also MOOC</li>
<li>Roger Peng Prof Biostats, John Hopkins</li>
<li>Jenny Bryan, Prof Stats, UBC.<br />
</li>
<li>Ben Marwick, Prof Archaelogy</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you engage new users? (Or what doesn’t work?)</p>
<p>Hadley: Start with visualization. +1 Jenny Jenny: Making an HTML page with .Rmd (+1 Mine), scaling/aggregation Roger: these days, they come to me excited about R Mine: I have to convince social scientists to use computers at all. Visualization, faceting etc helps, Rmd helps.<br />
Ben: Reproducible scripts, not click trails (Excel).</p>
<p>What’s the worst way to start?</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching data structures / programming first.</li>
</ul>
<p>teach loops, control structures?</p>
<ul>
<li>later / no. Mine teaches loops with index cards.</li>
<li>Hadley aims to to get people to re-invent lapply as a common pattern…</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping people engaged? (Break-out session to develop reading lists, user groups)</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine data hack weekend. (PhD students mentoring, undergrads doing).<br />
</li>
<li>Roger: capstone project. Track alumni (via linked-in, other ideas?)</li>
<li>Tracy: Pointing people to courses like Roger’s MOOC</li>
</ul>
<p>Engaging later-stage students?</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with own data and problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>R’s horrible gotchas (recycling, NA stuff, factor stuff, dropping columns/names)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hadley: 1) set the expectations that R has frustrations. 2) room / chance to fail safely, how to debug (google error).<br />
</li>
<li>Roger: 10 examples of annoying things in R</li>
<li>Jenny: user str and fear factors.</li>
<li>Ben: getting help</li>
<li>Roger: students with programming experience need different kind of help.</li>
</ul>
<p>R &amp; Github?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hadley, Mine – nope. Hadley - I didn’t commit to teaching it. Don’t try it at the end.</li>
<li>Roger – it’s better (though students think git == github). Avoid why git is awesome, just teach it in a narrow sense!<br />
</li>
<li>Jenny – intensive use of Github whole time, starting with it up front.<br />
</li>
<li>Ben: not with undergrads, yes with grads. takes time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Markdown, Github – if you’re gonna do it, commit and do everything in it from the beginning.</p>
<p>Hadley: If something feels painful, do it more often. (git, R CMD check).</p>
<p>Writing functions: need to learn eventually, but it’s really hard to teach. Hadley’s book exercises for the reader. Over time course gets simpler.</p>
<p>When do you teach data cleaning?</p>
<p>Jenny: a data-cleaning script itself cannot be clean. It’s an advanced topic I teach it midway.<br />
Jenny, Roger: includes teaching regex.</p>
<p>Find outside dataset mid-way, sudo-messy data.</p>
<p>Hadley: Hardest part is that students don’t know what the goal is, while I see it instantly. Takes a super long time to learn how to do this and to articulate this.</p>
<p>Data shouldn’t be too real, should be Disney-real (more real than reality). individual/personal they put in the time, so do a kaggle competition to clean data, top 3 winners get automatic A’s, opt out of final</p>
<p>Starting with spreadsheets and data entry!</p>
<p>Infrastructure for package building:</p>
<ul>
<li>takes time, possibly &gt; 30 min 1:1.</li>
<li>Mine: students run on cloud, I can replicate. but cannot run on own computer.</li>
<li>Roger: Better to live through the cli bs, once it’s done it’s done. VM’s not how the real world works. Hosting service for 1000s of people too expensive.</li>
<li>Jenny: pain is only when we need build environment</li>
<li><p>Ben: Use <em>local</em> Docker, replicates his own research. A slight taste of shell, but avoids CLI BS</p></li>
<li><p>install challenges is the opposite of a motivator / win. Luckily doesn’t bite early.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>peer review</li>
</ul>
