<p><em>ongoing notes comparing computing resources</em></p>
<p>Comparing compute resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, and Google Compute Engine look significantly cheaper than Rackspace, Azure, etc. (The Economist has estimated that AWS EC2 prices are roughly 3% <em>below</em> cost).</p></li>
<li><p>DigitalOcean tends to have the lowest price point for on-demand use of a given set of resources; usually comparable to the Amazon or EC2 persistent (e.g. monthly) use. All-inclusive pricing (storage, networking etc) and limited options make choices simple and total costs easy to anticipate, though lack the flexibility to fine-tune a configuration to pay for exactly what you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Google offers the best rate for higher-cpu instances, (e.g. 16 cores); primarily by provisioning them with less memory (0.9 GB/core) than DO or EC2.</p></li>
<li><p>Google configures disk space separately from instance type. Cost of $0.04 per GB for spinning disk storage, is quite a bit cheaper than the ~ $0.10/GB for AWS EBS, and in fact nearly S3 price ~ $0.03. This makes it a potentially compelling platform for high storage, low compute instances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Presumably this is non-local storage like EBS, since they also offer a (very expensive) local SSD option (limited to 375 GB increments, each inc at $81.75 / mo). Though if the non-local nature creates a significant latency, it isn’t clear why one would buy non-local SSD option for $0.17/GB.</p>

<h2>Using Google Compute Engine</h2>
<p>Web interface is cleaner but much less flexible than Amazon’s, most tasks must be done with the commandline SDK tool instead, <code>gcloud</code> (such as modifying firewall settings other than port 80 and port 443). For instance, <a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/#snappy-google">this tutorial</a> on running an Ubuntu Snappy Core image instead of the usual defaults.</p>
<p>Docker-machine makes this a bit easier, as usual. The user needs to create a project name and project id on the Google Cloud Engine web interface. Only the project-name is required as an argument to docker-machine (e.g. no authentication token), auth must be done interactively through a web terminal. It doesn’t seem that there is a way to turn on <code>http</code> port or otherwise configure the firewall. By default, all inbound ports are shut. By mapping to port <code>80</code> and checking ‘allow http’ in the web interface one can still access an app like RStudio-server (my mapping docker ports appropriately), but there doesn’t seem to be any way to automate this. (In contrast, with Amazon EC2, docker-machine automatically attaches a ‘security-group’ called <code>docker-machine</code>, so a user can customize the ports permitted on that security group to have, e.g. 8787 open by default.)</p>

<div id="performance-comparisons" class="section level2">
<h2>Performance comparisons</h2>
<p>CPU performance varies within a single provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>DO CPUs appear 2.3 - 2.4 Ghz with ~ 15MB cache,</li>
<li>Google CPUs around 2.6 Ghz with ~ 20MB cache,</li>
<li>Amazon ~ 2.8 Ghz with ~ 25 MB cache</li>
</ul>
<p>network i/o speeds seem reasonable on all.</p>

<div id="using-resources-with-docker-machine" class="section level2">
<h2>Using resources with docker-machine</h2>
<p>docker-machine with docker save: after committing the container, this saves the container locally rather than on the host. With even reasonable download speeds ~ 0.5MB/s this is quite slow. DigitalOcean download speeds are ~ 680 Mb/s, and upload about half that. Better yet, pushing the container back to the Hub only pushes the changed layers anyway, so is nearly instantaneous. The Hub also provides a private repo for free.</p>
<p>This provides a pretty compelling workflow of</p>
<ul>
<li><code>docker-machine create ...</code></li>
<li><code>docker run &lt;...&gt; user/private</code> and do stuff</li>
<li><code>docker commit container user/private</code>, <code>docker push user/private</code>, <code>docker-machine rm -f ...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>in order to deploy one’s work on temporary machine with appropriate power, and then save the work and close the machine. Using docker instead of the standard image ‘snapshots’ is probably faster and nicely independent of the machine and provider; and in this case the snapshot storage is free of cost as well.</p>
