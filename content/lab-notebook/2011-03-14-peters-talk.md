Peter spoke in Sebastian's lab meeting about a spatially explicit Moran model, for which he derives Fisher's wave equation and an ancestry process.  Here's what he says,


> the general plan is to describe a simple spatial model of adaptation (or, could be of invasion...); and use it to derive (Fisher's) traveling wave; the corrections that arise if you don't assume the population is infinitely large; and describe how to follow lineages back through the expanding wave.
