      I work on problems in ecological forecasting and decision making under
      uncertainty, with applications for global change, conservation and
      natural resource management. I am particularly interested in how we can
      predict or manage ecological systems that may experience regime shifts:
      sudden and dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available
      data.  The rapid expansion in both computational power and the available
      ecological and environmental data enables and requires new mathematical,
      statistical and computational approaches to these questions. Ecology
      has much to learn about what are and are not useful from advances in
      informatics & computer science, just as it has from statistics and
      mathematics. Traditional approaches to ecological modeling and resource
      management such as stochastic dynamic systems, Bayesian inference, and
      optimal control theory must be adapted both to take advantage of all
      available data while also dealing with its imperfections. My approach
      blends ecological theory with the synthesis of heterogeneous data and
      the development of software -- a combination now recognized as data
      science.<p/> <p><span rel="foaf:interest"> I am co-founder of the <a
