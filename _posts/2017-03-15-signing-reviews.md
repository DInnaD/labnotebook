title: signing reviews
---

As a graduate student and as a post-doc, I always signed my reviews. I would spend two to three full days on most reviews, and after that much effort, I felt signing was a way of getting a little credit from the authors if the review was helpful. I always felt this effort was appreciated, even (especially?) when critical. I’ve appreciated being acknowledged in the final papers when my reviews have been helpful, and in once case was made a co-author for correcting a key derivation. As a professor I’ve only rarely been able to spend that long on a review, and consequently I am more reluctant to sign. Sure, experience has made me faster in many ways, but a critical review of some dense derivations or subtle analysis is as time-demanding as ever.

While I’m sympathetic to the same gut feeling others have expressed about giving negative feedback, in practice I’m far more worried that I would lose some respect by signing a more superficial positive review than that I would be punished for a thorough but critical one. As I think has been discussed on Dynamic Ecology before, I don’t believe our field has that many bad actors in influential places — though certainly I could just be naiive or sheltered by privilege or good luck so far. I certainly respect the challenging position of the editors, who not only have to sign but also take the burden of the final call, which may hinge more on potentially subjective & thus more frustrating aspects such as relevance / importance rather than technical detail.

So, from only my own experience I think signing reviews as a grad student or post-doc can be the best time to do so; as it can give you the full attention and put you on the radar of influential people in your area that can be hard to get otherwise. I don’t think the risk is great since I believe such folk are more likely to be impressed by fair, thoughtful, critical review than star-struck pandering. Outside this case though I agree that it does not matter a great deal, as one has more avenues to engage once one becomes more established.
