<h1 id="abstact">Abstact</h1>

<p>While empirical evidence leans almost entirely in favor of allopatric
speciation, theoretical evolutionary models continue to suggest that
sympatric speciation should be possible, even common. We show stochastic
effects due to finite population sizes can pose a significant impediment
to the evolutionary branching. Early in branching, coexistence of the
diverging populations is protected by a very weak stabilizing force, as
trait differences are still small. Consequently stochastic collapse of
this weak coexistence is common on the evolutionary timescale required
for mutation-limited divergence. Sympatric branching mechanisms require
an evolutionary divergence to occur fast enough to prevent this eventual
collapse. Either rapid mutations or mutations of large effect are
required to traverse this branching point successfully - or otherwise a
population that begins to diverge in allopatry can find its branching
reinforced upon second contact by these sympatric effects.</p>

<p>Evolution demographic stochasticity branching adaptive dynamics</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Speciation is evolution at the grandest scale. Speciation is the
mechanism responsible for generating the astounding biodiversity that is
the most salient feature of life on Earth, and one of our most
threatened and irreplaceable resources. Speciation is also one of the
greatest mysteries of evolution, occurring primarily on scales of space
and time beyond our experimental reach, and through a delicate interplay
of events from the molecular shifting of nucleotides to the geologic
shifting of mountains and rivers. For organisms with sexual
reproduction, the process of speciation must account for the genetic
isolation of incipient species, and speciation models must therefore
embrace genetic dynamics (Coyne &amp; Orr 2004). Accounting for this genetic
dimension of speciation has been achieved largely at the expense of
simplifying, or ignoring altogether, speciation&rsquo;s ecological dimension.
The latter results from the complex features and interactions that
distinguish species from one another and that enable a rich diversity of
species to persist.</p>

<p>The importance of ecological interactions in speciation has been
acknowledged for some time (the concept of reinforcement goes back to
Dobzhansky and Wallace), yet few studies have had more influence in
highlighting the ecological basis for speciation then that by Dieckmann
and Doebeli (1999), which brought the nascent theory of mutation-limited
long-term phenotypic evolution known as ‘adaptive dynamics&rsquo; to the
attention of empirical and theoretical evolutionary ecologists. While
genetic dynamics are addressed in this study, at its heart lies an
ecological model for the evolutionary branching of a phenotypic trait
describing competitive interactions: in the course of adaptation, this
trait approaches an evolutionary branching point, i.e., an attractor of
the evolutionary dynamics of a single morph that, once reached through
directional selection, naturally leads to the emergence of a diverging
dimorphism through frequency-dependent disruptive selection. In this
project, we will focus on the dynamics around such evolutionary
branching points. While ignoring genetic details for a start, we will
extend previous work by focusing on the impacts of stochastic processes
on the evolutionary dynamics leading to biological diversification.</p>

<p>Almost all quantitative theories of evolution have relied on stochastic
models to address the impacts of chance events - such as mutations,
births, deaths, and environmental changes - that affect the evolutionary
process (Fisher 1937; Lande 1979; Coyne &amp; Orr 2004). Adaptive dynamics
theory typically considers two sources of stochasticity: random
mutations and the loss of advantageous mutants to chance extinction
while their numbers are small. What these models typically do not
consider is demographic stochasticity of resident populations (resulting
from intrinsic fluctuations through stochastic birth and death events in
finite populations of discrete individuals) and environmental
stochasticity (resulting from external fluctuations in the environmental
conditions a population experiences).</p>

<p>Several recent studies have tried to overcome these limitations.
Claessen et al. (2007, 2008) explore simulations of evolutionary
branching in small populations and found that demographic stochasticity
can delay or halt diversification. Johansson and Ripa (2006) explored
the impact that correlated environmental stochasticity has on
diversification. They assume that as populations diverge, the
environmental influences upon them become less similar. They demonstrate
that this correlation can facilitate coexistence early in the process of
branching, and as it weakens, the chance that a branch is lost
increases. While these studies make an excellent start, a more general
theory and mathematical framework is needed to untangle and quantify the
multitude of effects stochasticity has on evolutionary branching.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

<p>We consider the classic adaptive dynamics model for evolutionary
branching under competition for a limiting resource by Dieckmann and
Doebeli (1999). The population dynamics of $N(x,t)$ individuals each
with focal trait $x$ are given by a continuous time birth-death process
with rates</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
b(N) = &amp; r \nonumber <br />
d(N) = &amp; r \frac{\sum_yN(y,t)C(x,y)}{K(x)} .\label{general_logistic}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>The focal trait $x$ can be thought of as some continuous phenotypic
variable, such as beak size, which affects resource consumption. Niche
differences driving speciation arise from differences in this trait. In
the model, $K(x)$ is the resource kernel which determines the
equilibrium population density and $C(x,y)$ is a the competition kernel,
describing the relative change in death rate of individuals of type $x$
due to competition by individuals of type $y$. Given $C(x,x)=1$, the
equilibrium density of a monomorphic population is $N^{\ast}(x)=K(x)$.
Following \citet{dieckmann_nat1999} we assume the following Gaussian
forms,</p>

<p>$$K(x)=K_0e^{-x^2/(2\sigma_k^2)}, \label{K}$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$C(x,y)=e^{-(x-y)^2/(2\sigma_c^2)}, \label{C}$$</p>

<p>where $\sigma_k$ and $\sigma_c$ are scale factors for the resource
distribution and competition kernels respectively. $\sigma_c$ can be
though of as the niche size. We focus on the case $\sigma_k&gt;\sigma_c$,
for which the model has an evolutionary branching point at
$x=0$ \citep{geritz_evoeco1998}.</p>

<p>The evolutionary dynamics are specified only at the phenotypic level: We
assume that with probability $\mu$ an individual birth results in a
mutant offspring, and that the mutant trait is chosen from a Gaussian
distribution centered at the trait value of the parents and with a
variance $\sigma_{\mu}^2$.</p>

<h2 id="the-adaptive-dynamics-of-branching">The Adaptive Dynamics of Branching</h2>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3711/9624789620_a3f439eace_o.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Evolutionary branching occurs in this model when the resource kernel is
wider than the competition kernel, $\sigma_k &gt; \sigma_c$ as discussed
in \citet{geritz_evoeco1998, dieckmann_nat1999}. It is straight forward
to show that the invasion fitness $s(y,x) := b(K(x),x,y) -d(K(x), x,y)$
of a rare mutant $y$ in a population $x$ at equilibrium has a singular
point at $x^*=0$, the peak of the resource distribution. This is easily
confirmed by taking the second derivatives or observing the pairwise
invasibility plot [fig:pip].</p>

<h2 id="phases-of-branching">Phases of branching</h2>

<p>Evolutionary branching through this mechanism can be divided into four
phases. In the first phase, the population approaches the branching
point by repeated invasions that completely replace the monomorphic
population. This rate is governed by the canonical equation of adaptive
dynamics, a rate proportional to the size of mutational jumps relative
to the size of the resource kernel, $\sigma_{\mu}/\sigma_k$.
Mathematically, this phase can be defined by the $P_1$ region of the
pairwise invasibility plot. In this region, dimoprhisms are always
transient.</p>

<p>In the second phase, the population is near enough to the branching
point that mutations begin occuring in the coexistence region. More
precisely, any dimorphism that occurs in the $P_2$ region but where one
of the populations is too small to contribute to density-dependent
effects can be considered to be in this phase. The dynamics of this
phase are thus governed by the fixation probabilities of rare mutants
occuring in the coexistence region. This phase may often fail when a
rare mutant occurs in the coexistence region but is soon lost to drift.</p>

<p>The third phase begins when mutations in the coexistence region survive
the initial genetic drift to establish as significant frequencies in the
population. In this stage the density-dependent contribution of each
population is relevant. This stage may fail due to the loss of either
population, more often the one farther from the branching point. As this
is usually (but not necessarily) the resident population that gave rise
to the other population through mutation, the failure of this phase can
be thought of in terms of loss of the resident population, while the
second phase is governed primarily by the loss of the invader
population.</p>

<p>In the fourth phase, subsequent mutations farther from the branching
point invade and the populations move apart. Each time a mutant exterior
to the branching point successfully invades the probability the
coexistence becomes exponentially more stable, as we will demonstrate.
While the expected coexistence time for the two populations remains
similar to the evolutionary timescale over which new mutants enter and
establish, the coexistence may be lost, collapsing back to the second
phase. However, as the coexistence of the first pair (phase 3) is much
more likely to collapse than the subsequently more stable coexisting
pairs that arise from it, we will have a good approximation by
considering only the probabilty that the initial pair survives long
enough to enter phase four. This is justified by the Ahrennius
approximation result and confirmed by numerical simulation.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-the-approach">Overview of the approach</h3>

<p>The division into phases provides both a conceptual and mathematical
framework to address the branching process. Analyzing the first two
phases essentially consists of partitioning the space of possible
mutants: considering all the mutants that lie in the $P_1$ region that
are expected to invade and replace the resident (moving the population
closer to the branching point as per phase 1), and mutants that reach
the coexistence region $P_2$ in phase 2. This is done by partitioning
the domain of integration for an integral over mutant traits $y$ for
each resident $x$. The closer $x$ is to $x^*$ the more of this integral
lies in $P_2$ and entering phase two becomes increasingly probable. This
treatment follows along similar lines as the original derivation of the
canonical equation of adaptive dynamics \citep{dieckmann_jmb1996}.</p>

<p>The crux of the remaining third and fourth phases settles around
predicting the coexistence time. This is done through a diffusion
approximation approach to individual dynamics, which remains quite
technical to solve. To provide both an effective approximation and a
useful intuition, we demonstrate how this coexistence problem can be
construed as an escape from a potential energy well, as in classical
chemical kinetics. Understanding the depth of this well tells us most of
what we need to know about the coexistence time. Relating the
coexistence timescale to the evolutionary timescale wraps up the
calculation for how long branching will take.</p>

<p>The deterministic theory applies both the limit of rare mutations (small
$\mu$) and small mutational steps (small $\sigma_{\mu}$). In our
treatment, either one of these can become the limiting factor and
correspond to different regimes of adaptive branching. If mutations are
very rare, we&rsquo;ll see that the population must essentially survive phase
3 in a single mutational step. In this regime recieving a single
mutation far enough into the $P_2$ region to survive the coexistence
balance (phase 3 to 4). This corresponds to a single mutational step
that is on the order of the width of the competition kernel, $\sigma_c$.
Here branching is accomplished essentially by the single unlikely event
being “rolled,” and transitions between phases are slow but rarely
collapse to an earlier stage. When mutational step size is limiting,
many mutational steps are required to get any population a distance of
order $\sigma<em>c$ away - to escape the shadow of competition. In this
regime, successful branching appears as a lucky string of mutations,
like a long series of flipping a coin and coming up heads rather than
the singular improbable event. This regime is characterized by many
aborted branching attempts before one succeeds. The smaller $\mu$
becomes, the smaller the chances of seeing this lucky run within the
coexistence time. The smaller $\sigma</em>{\mu}$ becomes the smaller the
chances of seing the rare large jump within the coexistence time. When
both are too small relative to the coexistence time, the population will
fail to branch.</p>

<h2 id="approaching-the-branching-point">Approaching the branching point</h2>

<p>Classically, the approach to the branching point is governed by the
canonical equation of adaptive dynamics \citep{dieckmann_jmb1996}. To
account for branching we have to revisit the original derivation of this
equation where we relax the limit of small mutational steps sufficiently
to allow mutants to enter the coexitence region, $P_2$, in
Fig. [fig:pip]. The derivation of the canonical equation integrates only
over those mutants that fall into the invasion-substitution region,
$P_1$. However, since the derivation is done in the limit of small
mutational step sizes, this encompasses essentially all of the weight of
the mutational kernel, and to good approximation can thus be replaced
with the entire $P_1 \cup P_2$ region. Recall that in the derivation of
the canonical equation, deleterious mutations are given zero probability
of fixing (from the branching process approximation), and hence this
corresponds to integrating over half of the real line $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\bar x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mu N^*(x) \phantom \cdot \partial_y s(y,x) \Big|<em>x \int</em>{P_1} [y-x]^2 M(y-x) \mathrm{d}[y-x]
\label{canonical}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>The probability of such a mutant occurring in our monomorphic population
of trait $x$ is given by the probability that any mutant occurs (given
by the population size, approximately $K(x)$ at equilibrium, times the
birth rate $b(x)$ times the mutation rate $\mu$) times the probability
that the mutation lies on the opposite side of the coexistence boundary,
which we denote as $\phi(x)$ and $\psi(x)$, which is $\phi(x)$ reflected
across the line $y=x$. This depends on the mutational kernel, $M(y,x)$
which gives the probability that a mutant arising from a resident
population of trait $x$ bears trait $y$ that falls withing the
coexistance region as follows:</p>

<p>$$\int<em>{-\infty}^{\phi(x)} M(y,x) \mathrm{d}y + \int</em>{\psi(x)}^{\infty} M(y,x) \mathrm{d}y$$</p>

<p>Without loss of generality let us assume that the singular strategy
$x^* = 0$ and that we start from some trait value $x<em>0 &gt; x^*$.
Additionally, let us we assume $M(y,x)$ is Gaussian in $y-x$ with mean 0
and variance $\sigma</em>{\mu}^2$. However, we do not wish to consider all
such mutants $y$, but only those that survive. We multiply the
probability of a mutant having trait $y$, $M(y,x)$, times the
probability that is survives drift. This probability we quote from the
Galton-Watson branching process, $1-\tfrac{d(y,x)}{b(y,x)}$. Using our
model for birth and death rates , the probability of surviving branching
is</p>

<p>$$1-\frac{C(y,x)K(x)}{K(y)} := S(y,x)
\label{S}$$</p>

<p>which we denote as $S(y,x)$ as indicated. Hence we modify our integral
to consider all mutants $y &lt; x^*$ which occur with probability $M(y,x)$
and then survive with probability $S(y,x)$, and write down the rate
$P(x)$ at which a mutant which leads to branching occurs from our
monomorphic population with trait $x$:</p>

<p>$$P(x) := r \mu K(x)\left( \int<em>{-\infty}^{\phi(x)} M(y,x) S(y,x) \mathrm{d}y + \int</em>{\psi(x)}^{\infty} M(y,x) S(y,x) \mathrm{d}y  \right)
\label{MSerf}$$</p>

<p>Though a little cumbersome, this can be written in nearly closed form
(using the error function). For our particular model $s(y,x)$, we can
write the boundaries $\phi(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ as</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\phi(x) = x\frac{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}+1}{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}-1} \nonumber <br />
\psi(x) = x\frac{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}-1}{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}+1}
\label{phipsi}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Then, given a starting condition $x_0$, we can determine the expected
trait $x$ at time $t$ of a monomorphic resident population by
integrating the canonical equation,</p>

<p>$$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2} \mu \sigma_{mu}^2 N^*(x) \partial_y s(y,x)$$</p>

<p>which for our model is</p>

<p>$$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{-x}{2\sigma<em>k^2} r \mu \sigma</em>{\mu}^2 K(x)$$</p>

<p>While no closed form solution exists for $x(t)$ in this case, if we
assume $x_0 \ll \sigma_k$ then to good approximation we can view $K(x)$
to be constant over the interval and take our path to be:</p>

<p>$$x(t) = x<em>0 \exp\left( -r \mu \sigma</em>{\mu}^2 K_0 t/\sigma_k^2\right)$$</p>

<p>Using this mean path, we can write down an approximation for the rate of
a branching mutant occurring as a function of time, $P(x(t))$. Using
this time dependent rate, the probability of not branching after time
$T$ is simply $\exp\left( - \int_0^T P(t)\mathrm{d}t \right)$. One minus
this is the probability branching by time $T$; i.e. the cumulative
density function, hence the probability density function for the waiting
time is:</p>

<p>$$\Pi(T) = P(x(T)) \exp\left( -\int_0^T P(x(t)) \right)
\label{pdf}$$</p>

<p>and the expected time to complete phases 1 and 2 is
$\int_0^{\infty} T \Pi(T) \mathrm{d}T$. This is our first analytic
approximation.</p>

<h2 id="coexistence">Coexistence</h2>

<p>Consider a population of two coexisting types, characterized by traits
$x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. The birth and death rates of each
population are then given by expression  . We&rsquo;ll assume that the
populations can coexist, that is $(x_1, x_2)$ falls into the coexistence
region $P_2$; <em>i.e.</em> that $C(x_1,x_2)K(x_2) /K_1(x_1) &lt; 1 $ and
$C(x_1, x_2) K(x_1)/K(x_2) &lt; 1$. This guarentees that each population
has a positive expected growth rate when rare. However, because the
population is composed of finitely many discrete individuals, there is
still a chance that either type will be lost to chance; to demographic
stochasticity. We whish to characterize the expected waiting time for
such an event to occur.</p>

<p>To do so, we will switch first into density and then frequency, to
obtain a one-dimensional expression we can solve exactly. We will then
use the Arhennius approximation to obtain a closed form solution. First,
we will replace the discrete number of individuals $N$ with the
macroscopic, continuous variable $n$, representing the mean <em>density</em> of
individuals; $N/A$, where $A$ is the area in which $N$ individuals are
found. For suitably large $A$, we will be able to accurately describe
$n$ with a coupled stochastic differential equation for each population.
By changing variables once more into the frequency of one type,
$p = n_1/(n_1+n_2)$ and $n = n_1 + n_2$, we are able to do a timescale
seperation to focus on the dynamics in a single variable, $p$.</p>

<p>The master equation that describes the probability of observing $N_i$
individuals of type $i$ is given by,</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} P(N_1,t) &amp;= (\text{E}_1 - 1) r N_1 \frac{N_1 + C(x_1, x_2) N_2}{K(x_1) }P(N_1) + (\text{E}_1^{-1} - 1)r N_1 P(N_1) \nonumber <br />
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} P(N_2,t) &amp;= (\text{E}_2 - 1) r N_2 \frac{N_2 + C(x_2, x_1) N_1}{K(x_2) }P(N_2) + (\text{E}_2^{-1} - 1)r N_2 P(N_2)
\label{mastereq}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>where $\text{E}_i^k$ is the step operator taking
$f(N<em>i) \to f(N</em>{i+k})$. We apply van Kampen&rsquo;s expansion of the master
equation to linear order to recover the following stochastic
differential equation (Itô equation)</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}n_1 = r n_1 \left(1 -  \frac{n_1 + C(x_1, x_2) n_2}{K(x_1) } \right) \mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{K_o} } \sqrt{r n_1 \left(1 +  \frac{n_1 + C(x_1, x_2) n_2}{K(x_1) } \right) } \mathrm{d}W_1
\label{sde}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>and $n_2$ similarly. Switching into the variables for frequency,
$p = n_1/n$ and $n = n_1+n_2$ and simplying notation by
$C(x_1, x<em>2) = c</em>{12}$ and $K(X_i) = k_i$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}p &amp;= r p \left(1 -  n(p) \frac{p + c_{12}(1-p) }{k_1 } \right) \mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{K<em>o n(p)} } \sqrt{r p \left(1 +  n(p)\frac{p + c</em>{12} (1-p) }{k_1 } \right) } \mathrm{d}W_1  \label{freq_sde} <br />
n(p) &amp;=  \frac{k_1 k_2}{k_2 p^2 + (k_1+k<em>2) c</em>{12} p (1-p) + k1 (1-p)^2 }, \end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>where we have set the dynamic equation for $n(p)$ to equilibrium. The
extinction probability $u(p,t)$ for this expression is given by the
Backwards equation for the generator,</p>

<p>$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) = \underbrace{r p \left(1 -  n(p) \frac{p + c_{12}(1-p) }{k<em>1 } \right)}</em>{A(p)} \partial_p u(p,t) + \tfrac{1}{2} \underbrace{\frac{1}{K<em>o n(p) } r p \left(1 +  n(p)\frac{p + c</em>{12} (1-p) }{k<em>1 } \right)}</em>{B(p)} \partial_p^2 u(p,t)
\label{u}$$</p>

<p>with the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = 1$ and $u(1,t) = 1$ being
absorbing.</p>

<p>Assuming that type 1 is the rare mutant invader, we can solve this
explicitly for small $p$, and particularly for the case of exactly one
new mutant. After some rearrangement we can rewrite this as</p>

<p>$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) = \left( rp \left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right) - \frac{r n}{k<em>1} p^2 (1 - c</em>{12} )\right)  \partial<em>p u(p,t) <br />
+ \left( rp \left(1+\frac{n c</em>{12}}{k_1}\right)  + \frac{r n }{k<em>1} p^2 (1 - c</em>{12} ) \right) \frac{\partial_p^2 u(p,t)}{2K_0 n}\end{gathered}$$</p>

<p>Note then for $p$ small we can neglect the terms quadratic in $p$ and we
are left with the backwards equation from the density independent case,</p>

<p>$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) =  rp \left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right)   \partial<em>p u(p,t) + rp \left(1+\frac{n c</em>{12}}{k_1}\right)   \frac{\partial_p^2 u(p,t)}{2K_0 n}$$</p>

<p>Setting equal to zero we have a simple ordinary differential equation
for the stationary extinction probability:</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
u(p) &amp;= 1 - e^{-2sp K<em>0 n} <br />
s &amp;= \frac{r\left( 1-\frac{n c</em>{12}}{k<em>1} \right) }{ r\left(1+\frac{n c</em>{12}}{k_1}\right)} \end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>and particularly for a frequency $p$ corresponding to a single
individual, a frequency of
$p=1/(N_1+N_2) =(1/K_0)/(n_1+n_2) = 1/(K_0 n)$, this reduces to</p>

<p>$$u = 1-e^{-2s}$$</p>

<p>Assuming $ rp \left( 1-\frac{k<em>2 c</em>{12}}{k_1} \right) \neq 0$, the
time-dependent solution<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is:</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
u(p,t) &amp;= 1-e^{-p \psi(t) } <br />
\psi(t) &amp;= \frac{2 s K_0 n}{1-e^{ r\left( 1-\frac{k<em>2 c</em>{12}}{k_1} \right) t } }
\label{timedep}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Larger population (system size) $K_o$ results in longer persistance.</p>

<p>This tells us nothing about the survival of the resident, as it is only
valid for small $p$. In most applications of this approach, it is
assumed the resident quickly goes extinct once $p \sim o(1)$. If we
consider the asymptotic behavior of the nonlinear PDE, Eq. , we see sure
absorbtion at one boundary or the other. The asymptotic behavior needn&rsquo;t
concern us; as we really want to know how the expected lifetime of this
dimporphic state compares with the rate at which mutants are entering
this population. To do so we need the time dependent solution to the
nonlinear backwards equation .</p>

<p>While a direct solution to the nonlinear PDE is not available, we can
solve for the moments analytically. As $u(p,t)$ is the probability of
non-extinction, that is, that the exit time $T$ is greater than the
current time $t$; e.g. $u$ is the cumululative probability density.
Consequently the mean exit time $T(p)$ is given by,</p>

<p>$$T(p) = - \int_0^\infty t \partial_t u(p,t) \mathrm{d}t = \int_0^\infty u(p,t) \mathrm{d}t \label{simple}$$</p>

<p>where we have integrated by parts to get the second expression.
Meanwhile, we can integrate the left-hand side of ,</p>

<p>$$\int_0^{\infty} \partial_t u(p,t) \mathrm{d}t = u(p,\infty) - u(p,0) = -1$$</p>

<p>and integrate the right hand side using  to get</p>

<p>$$A(p) \partial_p T(p) + \tfrac{1}{2} B(p) \partial_p^2 T(x) = -1$$</p>

<p>This can be integrated directly to solve for the mean time starting from
$p=x$ to be absorbed at either boundary $a=0$ or $b=1$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
T(x) &amp;= \frac{2 \left[\left(\int_a^x\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\psi(y)}\right)\int_x^b \frac{\mathrm{d}y&rsquo;}{\psi(y&rsquo;)} \int_a^{y&rsquo;} \frac{\mathrm{d}z \psi(z)}{B(z)} - \left(\int_x^b\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\psi(y)}\right)\int_a^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y&rsquo;}{\psi(y&rsquo;)} \int_a^{y&rsquo;} \frac{\mathrm{d}z \psi(z)}{B(z)}\right]}{\int_a^b \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\psi(y)}}
\label{7integrals}
\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\psi(x) &amp;= \exp\left( \int_0^x \mathrm{d}x&rsquo; \frac{2A(x&rsquo;)}{B(x&rsquo;)} \right)\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>Though these integrals can be computed numerically, a small noise limit
(large populations) allows us to make an additional approximation by
mapping this problem onto the familiar question of escape over a
potential energy barrier. This question arises in basic chemistry, and
is described by a similar stochastic differential equation where the
$A(x)$ coefficent represents the gradient of the energy surface and $B$
the temperature. The analogy initially appears to fail, since in the
chemical context the diffusion coefficent is determined by the
temperature alone, and is independent of the state, while our $B$ term
depends on the frequency $p$. However, as it is not explicitly time
dependent, there is always a transform to change variables into a
context where $B$ is constant. The relevant transformation for us is
known as the Lamperti Transform. Switching variables from $p$ to $q$ by
means of the transform:</p>

<p>$$q = F(p) = \int_z^{p} \frac{1}{\sqrt{B(u)}} \mathrm{d}u
\label{p_to_q}$$</p>

<p>we can rewrite  as</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u(q,t)}{\partial t} = \underbrace{\left(\frac{4 A(p)- \partial<em>p B(p) }{4\sqrt{B(p)}}  \right)}</em>{\nabla V(p)} \frac{\partial u(q,t)}{\partial q} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 u(q,t)}{\partial q^2}.
\label{new_u}\end{aligned}$$</p>

<p>The mean first passage time in this transformed variable is still solved
by . However, interpreting the coefficent of the drift term as the
gradient of the energy landscape, $\nabla V(p)$, we can approximate that
this time will scale as the exponent of the depth of the energy well
defined by that landscape:</p>

<p>$$\exp{- (\min(V(0), V(1)) - V(p^*) )}$$</p>
