      <description>The NIH has recently announced the report of a landmark meeting which presents a vision for a Software Discovery Index (SDI). The report is both timely and focused on the key issues of locating, citing, reusing software:
 Software developers face challenges disseminating their software and measuring its adoption. Software users have difficulty identifying the most appropriate software for their work. Journal publishers lack a consistent way to handle software citations or to ensure reproducibility of published findings.</description>

      <description>Academic research takes place in computational environments of continually increasing complexity. This creates ever-higher barriers not only to reproducing or extending the results of other researchers, but also barriers to collaboration and training of new researchers.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if we could all work in equivalent computing environments, such that whatever worked for me on my computer would work for you on yours? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if we could just clone and copy our entire software environment when we needed to move our computations over to a more powerful cloud or cluster computer?</description>

      <description>Ticking through a few more of the challenges I raised in my first post on docker; here I explore some of the issues about facilitating interaction with a docker container so that a user&amp;rsquo;s experience is more similar to working in their own environment and less like working on a remote terminal over ssh. While technically minor, these issues are probably the first stumbling blocks in making this a valid platform for new users.</description>

      <description>An update on my exploration with Docker. Title courtesy of Ted, with my hopes that this really does move us in a direction where we can spend less time thinking about the tools and computational environments. Not there yet though
I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten RStudio Server working in the ropensci-docker image (Issues/pull requests welcome!).
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 cboettig/ropensci-docker  will make an RStudio server instance available to you in your browser at localhost:8787.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This post was originally drafted as a set of questions to the revived ropensci-discuss list, hopefully readers might join the discussion from there.
Been thinking about Docker and the discussion about reproducible research in the comments of Rich et al&amp;rsquo;s recent post on the rOpenSci blog where quite a few of people mentioned the potential for Docker as a way to facilitate this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only just started playing around with Docker, and though I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed, I&amp;rsquo;m still rather skeptical that non-crazies would ever use it productively.</description>

      <description>Berkeley Collaborative Environment Trying out the Berkeley image (Essentially ubuntu 14.04 XFCE with ipython and RStudio installed, but finely tuned to improve user experience; e.g. solid colors for faster remote window connections.)
Highly recommend their paper for the first explanation I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been able to follow that provides a definition of &amp;ldquo;DevOpts&amp;rdquo; (essentially, using scripts rather than documentation to manage consistent cross-platform installation) and explains the differences and similarities between the various programs operating in this sphere, sometimes as alternatives and simultaneously.</description>

      <description>Some thoughts on collaborating with markdown / dynamic document workflow Collaborating on manuscripts with other researchers when not writing in MS Word has been a perpetual nuisance for those of us not using Word (no doubt the others might say the same). When I first began writing papers I worked in LaTeX, and at that time I collaborated largely with others who already knew TeX (e.g. my mentors), so this wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a problem.</description>

      <description>Used some down-time while traveling to hammer out a long overdue update to my knitcitations package.
My first task inovled a backwards-compatible update fixing a few minor issues (see NEWS) and providing pandoc style inline citations v0.6-2, on CRAN.
I followed this with a ground-up rewrite, as I summarize in NEWS:
v1.0-1 This version is a ground-up rewrite of knitcitations, providing a more powerful interface while also streamlining the back end, mostly by relying more on external libraries for knitty gritty.</description>

      <description>Ben Bolker has an excellent post on this complex issue over at Dynamic Ecology, which got me thinking about writing my own thoughts on the topic in reply.
Google recently announced that it will be making it&amp;rsquo;s own self-driving cars, rather than modifying those of others. Cars that won&amp;rsquo;t have steering wheels and pedals. Just a button that says &amp;ldquo;stop.&amp;rdquo; What does this tell us about the future of user-friendly complex statistical software?</description>

      <description>PLOS has posted an excellent update reflecting on their experiences a few months in to their new data sharing policy, which requires authors to include a statement of where the data can be obtained rather than providing it upon request. They do a rather excellent job of highlighting common concerns and offering well justified and explained replies where appropriate.
At the end of the piece they pose several excellent questions, which I reflect on here (mostly as a way of figuring out my own thoughts on these issues).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the way rmarkdown looks like it can pretty much replace my [Makefile approach]() with a simple R command to rmarkdown::render(). Notably, a lot of the pandoc configuration can already go into the document&amp;rsquo;s yaml header (bibliography, csl, template, documentclass, etc), avoiding any messing around with the Makefile, etc.
Even more exciting is the pending RStudio integration with pandoc. This exposes the features of the rmarkdown package to the RStudio IDE buttons, but more importantly, seems like it will simplify the pandoc/latex dependency issues cross-platform.</description>

      <description>For a while now most of my active research is developed through .Rmd scripts connected to a particular project repository (something I discuss at length in deep challenges with knitr workflows). In the previous post I discuss creating a template package with a more transparent organization of files, such as moving manuscripts from inst/doc/ to simply manuscripts/. This left these exploratory analysis scripts in inst/examples in a similarly unintuitive place.</description>

      <description>While I have made my workflow for most of my ongoing projects available on Github for some time, this does not mean that it has been particularly easy to follow. Further, as I move from project to project I have slowly improved how I handle projects. For instance, I have since added unit tests (with testthat) and continuous integration (with travis-ci) to my repositories, and my handling of manuscripts has gotten more automated, with richer latex templates, yaml metadata, and simpler and more powerful makefiles.</description>

      <title>Deep challenges to dynamic documentation in daily workflows</title>

      <description>We often discuss dynamic documents such as Sweave and knitr in reference to final products such as publications or software package vignettes. In this case, all the elements involved are already fixed: external functions, code, text, and so forth. The dynamic documentation engine is really just a tool to combine them (knit them together). Using dynamic documentation on a day-to-day basis on ongoing research presents a compelling opportunity but a rather more complex challenge as well.</description>

      <description>For the past four years I have made an effort to sign all my reviews (which I try to keep to about one a month). It isn&amp;rsquo;t because I believe in radical openness or something crazy like that. Its really just my self interest involved &amp;ndash; at least mostly. Writing a review is an incredibly time consuming, and largely thankless task. Supposedly anonymous peer review is supposed to protect the reviewer, particularly the scenario of the less established scientist critiquing the work of the more established.</description>

      <description>Labnotebook  Configure Github CDN Hmm, jekyll-assets. Not sure that this is preferable from just using the makefile to compile and minify assets seperately as needed. Move www.carlboettiger.info to host from gh-pages branch of labnotebook. This self-contained system is more standard, and it is strange for other gh-pages hosting to be using the same domain/subdomain to reference content that is actually on a gh-pages branch of some totally different repository.</description>

      <description>labnotebook Updates to configuration to be more portable and lightweight:
 Drop APIs for Mendeley and Github in favor of just pulling from atom/rss feeds. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a platform-specific API or authentication, and has proven more robust, if sometimes less flexible and fancy. Drop git-modified and sha timestamps. It&amp;rsquo;s nice having these on the pages and included in the rdfa, but the information is accessible from the git repository and from Github.</description>

Best practices for R client packages to REST APIs  (When) Do we return response call metadata? Very modular function construction Error handling, assertthat checks Explicit parsing, as seperate function. e.g. Better alternatives in place of require when loading SUGGESTS lists, which still pollutes the namespace; see examples in httr.</description>

      <description>Editorial note: The following is slightly edited text from my post to R-devel discussing this issue, which I first drafted here.
 There seems to be some question of how frequently changes to software packages result in irreproducible results. I am sure that research using functions like glm and other functions that are shipped with base R are quite reliable; and after all they already benefit from being versioned with R releases (as Jeroen has argued).</description>

      <description>2014-02-19 R allows you to specify &amp;gt;= in a package dependency, not ==. The Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN, makes no requirement that package authors do not break their previous function API. For instance, if version 0.1 of the package had a function
foo &amp;lt;- function(x, y = 5){ ... }  then one could add new functionality in say, version 0.2 without breaking the existing API with a definition that looked like:</description>

      <description>Scientific Research: Moving beyond bubbles to platforms. The Economist contrasts the current start-up culture to that of the dotcom bubble. Their special report argues that while the dotcom bubble was characterized by heavy investment in a single idea with a &amp;ldquo;Build it and they will come&amp;rdquo; attitude, the current generation of startups is characterized by tinkering and rapid experimentation. They argue that this is possible thanks to the cheaply available &amp;ldquo;platforms&amp;rdquo; of open source software, cloud computing, APIs, and social media dissemination.</description>

Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t jotted these down in one place before, though I might copy my reply here for my future reference, or in case anyone else is interested in my list.
There&amp;rsquo;s a variety of sub-topics one might focus on; though in my opinion there&amp;rsquo;s no good, consise overview of all of the topics in one place.</description>

 Sounds like being accused of some scandal, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
I&amp;rsquo;m not generally active on it - my impression is that the open science community is mostly skeptical about ResearchGate and any other &amp;ldquo;Social Network&amp;rdquo; for scientists, largely on the grounds that &amp;ldquo;we already use the same social networks everyone else uses.&amp;rdquo; Some object on more philosophical grounds (profit, Mendeley, etc), but heck I publish in Elsevier/Springer/Wiley so I won&amp;rsquo;t preach.</description>

Far from implemented, though the tools and resources at the newly created Project Open Data (hosted on Github!) look very promising. Some choice quotations below:

      <description>Mendeley API for Jekyll Finally finished off my Mendeley API for Jekyll (The top uses the Ruby API implementation from Michael Bus, copied here since it is not yet provided as a gem. scroll to the bottom for my plugin code). The Mendeley API implementation is remarkably clumsy. For instance, rather than allowing queries to the API that specify a user&amp;rsquo;s folder and a sort-by field, we are forced to first query the folder for a list of IDs and then query document details on every document in the folder, after which we can sort locally.</description>

      <description>All I really wanted to do is cite a paper in the R Journal, which is peer-reviewed, open access (CC-BY), LaTeX based and without author charges. Sure, I could do that already, but I like being able to programmatically generate citation metadata from a URL &amp;ndash; we do have this thing called the internet now, and citations are just links, right? Unfortunately, nice as it is, the R journal doesn&amp;rsquo;t have HTML landing pages for articles that embed the metadata.</description>

This provoked a lively discussion among authors, editors, and other reviewers of software papers (most of us having been on at least both reviewing and authoring end), with quite varied perspectives as to whether such criteria were appropriate in this context. As I describe there, I view the concept of dedicated software papers as a somewhat necessary &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; of the publishing system, and hope a more mature system will eventually come into place, as is now happening for data through efforts such as Dryad and associated journal archiving requirements.</description>

      <description>Below are my scribble notes in prep for an interview with Richard, a writier for Nature.
 Advice for early-career scientists on how to think about organizing and publishing research data online.
Things like - why do it,
 Good for science (idealist), good for reputation (careerist), etc, but most importantly: helps you do your research.

      <description>I was recently impressed to learn of Trevor Bedford&amp;rsquo;s strategy of seeking pre-approval for posting his reviewer&amp;rsquo;s comments as Github issues. Beyond providing links to the data and source-code, I generally don&amp;rsquo;t advertise the open science nature of papers I submit &amp;ndash; I guess I assume that if the reader or reviewers care, it should be easy enough for them to discover it. Consequently I am usually immediately frustrated to realize that upon receiving my reviews I have to create a second, private repository for the review material, our replies to reviewers, etc.</description>

Is there a way to obtain DOI for a @github repository? (for citing #opensource software packages, similar to @figshare objects) #git
&amp;mdash; Ahmed Moustafa (@AhmedMoustafa) May 29, 2013 
Again and again, researchers suggest that DOI to makes something &amp;ldquo;citable&amp;rdquo;. And this frustrates me.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I love DOIs, and I love CrossRef. And I bang on the table when I have some old journal article that doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a DOI.</description>

      <description>Robust archiving through CLOCKSS One of the most comprehensive approaches I have come across so far uses figshare. This offers the most promising avenue for content preservation, but is weakest in managing the URIs and associating them with the original content. All figshare content is archived by CLOCKSS, an international library cooperation providing redundant and geopolitically distributed backup of the archives around the world (and used by many academic journals, both subscription based &amp;amp; open access).</description>

      <description>Note: this entry is part of a series of posts which explain some of the technical features of my lab notebook.
Archival preservation of digital scholarly content is an important challenge throughout the research community. As the notebook is the permanent record of my regular scholarly endeavors, this provides the opportunity to experiment with tools and techniques for digital archiving while also better preserving the notebook. In the experimental spirit that drives all my exploration here, I am testing several ways to accomplish this.</description>

      <description>Author&amp;rsquo;s Note: Having refrained from actually posting this for 8 months, as I think I have quite mellowed more my critique. I do believe that education and peer review are the best way forward in tackling these issues, but cannot overstate how much of a long and rocky road that process will be. The Mozilla Science Foundation is really leading these efforts with their code review pilots (as I have discussed in posts since writing this), and through their work with Software Carpentry training.</description>

      <description>Sustainable Research Happened across a provocative example of why we need a software ecosystem, though it was certainly not intended to be one, which led me to ask myself:
 How complex does an algorithm have to be before a talented researcher with expertise in both the relevant mathematics and computer science will make a significant mistake in their first release of the software?
 As a corollary we might also ask, &amp;ldquo;How much less care do we put into research code not destined for release?</description>

      <description>In keeping this open lab notebook, I have sought to address three goals (in addition to all the traditional reasons for keeping a lab notebook)
 Provide an educational resource Experiment with scientific infrastructure and tools for sharing and replicating research Facilitate the rapid and open dissemination of scientific research  which are coincidentally evocative of NSF&amp;rsquo;s Broader Impacts areas. In this series of posts I plan to explore and illustrate some of my experiments to address these goals through various web-based tools available for an open notebook platform.</description>

      <description>I now use the dynamic documentation software called knitr to write most entries that shore results and figures. The code to replicate the results is included automatically, ensuring that what I say I did and what code I actually ran to get the results are consistent. Though I have written about knitr before, both regarding its use in my notebook and in my manuscripts, here I provide a quick summary of how a reader might actually reproduce a figure or result they come across in the notebook, as well as some of the possible problems involved.</description>

      <description>In a post a while back I originally put forward the idea of a semantic lab notebook. Semantics, or linked data, are among the most powerful concepts to emerge in online science for scholarly data organization and communication. I have slowly been adding and exploring new ways to introduce semantic concepts into the notebook, which I have documented along the way under my #semantics tag. In this post, rather than discuss how to generate the semantic data, I try to focus on some of the things we can do with it.</description>

      <description>Today I dug out a handful (37) posts from the past two years that were published as #delayed-release content (and have all been tagged as such to indicate they were not public at their publication date). Many of these were connected to the #warning-signals project but involved results that I or Alan weren&amp;rsquo;t ready to provide ahead of publication, as I discussed in a post when I first began marking some posts for delayed release, challenges with collaboration in open science These posts were created while on the Wordpress platform and had been marked private, so that they would be invisible to public browsing.</description>

      <description>I have on ocassion been exploring the use of semantic markup in the notebook. In this post I illustrate how I am handling semantic citations. One of the more intriguing ideas is the ability to add semantic meaning to citations through the CITO ontology of Shotton (2010). Citation counts form a central part of academic discourse, but contain very little information regarding the reason for the citation. Most notably, &amp;lsquo;negative&amp;rsquo; citations refuting a claim carry just the same weight as those confirming or relying upon a claim.</description>

      <description>Figures have been one of the standing challenges of the open notebook. Displaying figures online requires that they are first uploaded to a server somewhere. Recently I have used automated uploads to external servers such as figshare to host all images generated in the course of my research, and simply point to those graphs which I wish to include in a notebook page using an image link. Unfortunately, this means that the images themselves are not being permanently archived when I deposit my notebook entries into their annual archives on figshare.</description>

      <description>Consider public archiving for your dissertation As researchers we spend an immense amount of time generating products other than papers. While we go through great lengths to see that our papers are published in just the right place to be seen by our colleagues (fretting about the different impact factors, percieved audience, editorial boards, open access policies, and many other factors that determine just how a paper will see the light of day), other products of our labors largely languish on forgotten hard-drives from long ago.</description>

      <description>Github issues tracker has increasingly become my research to-do list. Far beyond bugs and features of the code associated with the project, the issues sign-post different directions for investigation and the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made in each. Tags serve to group issues related to a common sub-project (as in my pdg-control) repo or priotize tasks (as in my nonparametric-bayes repo.
Issues not only have title and tags, but support a comment thread for progress and discussion of the issue.</description>

      <description>plots for the notebook I have started uploading images to my own server, rather than flickr. Programmatically, this is just a matter of switching the knitr upload function:
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = socialR::notebook.url)  from my custom flickr.url function (a wrapper to Rflickr) to a custom function notebook.url using a system call to cp (to my local jekyll notebook) and rsync (so the figure displays before my next jekyll push).
The new script names image by date and the first 10 characters of the sha hash, as well as the knitr chunk name.</description>

The rfigshare package written by Ted Hart and myself can do just this, once we puzzled out some of the same challenges (Notes to Titus: though the documentation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention it, you can get a programmatic list of available categories from http://api.figshare.com/v1/categories. Figshare can also take code as a fileset or dataset, and may soon add a type for it.</description>

      <description>Better tagging practices  Standardize use of tags: Match tags in notebook to project repository name. Tag papers in Mendeley by these tags as well.  I have also started tracking the medium of discovery for each paper I add to my Mendeley collection through a little set of Mendeley tags. I am curious to see through which mediums I obtain the most content, and what content. As with any ontology, I will struggle to select a vocabulary that is precise enought to be useful without being too verbose (b) to bother to continue to use this.</description>

      <description>All notebook entries are formatted with XHTML compliant (polyglot) HTML5 semantic structure. This means that any entry can be parsed with a generic XML parser to extract the entry content in &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;, the &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;, etc. The &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; section provides &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; and essential &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; tags declaring the character encoding (which also sets the MIME type for HTML5).

      <description>As the lab notebook grows, to make the maximum use of content it would be particularly useful to maximize the ability for a computer to understand the content, allowing us to identify, manipulate, and connect data using scripts and software. This is the concept of linked data, or a semantic notebook. I have explored this this idea before in the context of a wordpress-based platform, but now that Jekyll has let me strip away some of the abstraction of Wordpress it seems a good time to revisit this idea.</description>

      <description>Exploring the use of automated feeds in my notebook entries, which would make writing posts both faster and more complete. I had recently modified my Jekyll plugins to include commits on the day of the post. Consequently, I could add a bit of liquid code to any post, such as:
{% raw %}
{% octokit_commits pdg_control%}  {% endraw %}
(or even to the post template) and have the commit log for the specified repository automatically imported.</description>

      <description>Trying out rendering my notebook using Ethan Schoonover&amp;rsquo;s Solarized color scheme. The solarized palette has been selected according to Ethan&amp;rsquo;s exacting standards for contrast, symmetry, and readability.
My site CSS is built with Twitter-Bootstrap, which uses LESS to generate CSS files. Normal CSS is valid LESS code too, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the concept of a variable. So changing colors in CSS requires changing each and every occurance of some hex colorcode.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my lab notebook, version 3.0. My original open lab notebooks began on the wiki platform OpenWetWare, moved to a personally hosted Wordpress platform, and now run on a Jekyll-powered platform (site-config), but the basic idea remains the same. For completeness, earlier entries from both platforms have been migrated here. Quoting from my original introduction to the Wordpress notebook:

      <description>This Open Lab Notebook started on a public MediaWiki-based site, OpenWetWare (OWW), which was created with the ambitious vision of having a single wiki for biological sciences (or at least, synthetic microbiology, since such the wiki grew out of a collection of such labs). Users could have their own pages that served as a personal website or lab group site, contribute pages on specific protocols, host course websites, and most interestingly, were encouraged to create open lab notebooks using specially designed templates for the purpose.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a recent bugfix in the exitwp scripts I was able to export all my Wordpress entries. The script pulls the entries from the Wordpress database and formats them in markdown, along with extracting all metadata such as timestamp, tags, categories, publication status, and Wordpress id number, which are all embedded as YAML header information.
Why migrate the old entries? When I moved to the Jekyll notebook, I left the Wordpress site standing with all its existing content and simply remapped the home pages.</description>

      <description>Earlier today, Scott Collins, the president of the Ecological Society of America has announced that the society will now accept articles that have previously been posted on preprint servers. This comes on the heels of a growing discussion in our community. Ethan White has a good summary over on Jabberwocky Ecology.
Many voices have joined the discussion over the past month, and it is exciting and vindicating to see the Society engage and discuss these questions.</description>

      <description>The rOpenSci Project Carl Boettiger, Scott Chamberlain, Karthik Ram Sharing scientific data is a win for individual scientists as well as for the larger enterprise of other researchers, publishers, funders, educators, and the general public. Despite the rapid increase of public data, most researchers continue to work on their own data just as before. We lack the both the tools and training to quickly and easily leverage such data. To address some of these challenges, we have created the rOpenSci project.</description>

      <description>Jekyll works wonderfully with little knowledge beyond basic html/css to create _layout templates and then you&amp;rsquo;re free to write beautiful pages and posts in markdown. But adding more dynamic content, the kind of cool stuff avialable in so many wordpress plugins, tends to require a little understanding of the template formatting language, Liquid. Liquid is actually super simple and powerful way to build a dynamic website. The project&amp;rsquo;s wiki provides a great introduction, starting with</description>

      <description>This post outlines my current research workflow. This has evolved over time, so only my most recent projects hold completely to it, though almost all my projects follow the general R package structure. Two main differences are visible in my earlier projects: I used to keep scripts in demo before they became the more complete knitr markdown in inst/examples. I previously relied on a custom package called socialR to post results from those scripts to flickr, and would then embed the results in my Wordpress notebook, linking back to the demo file in Github.</description>

If you subscribe, the new RSS (atom) feed for the new notebook is at http://carlboettiger.info/atom.xml. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any feedback, good or bad, about the switch. A recent post gives my own reflections. The site&amp;rsquo;s source-code is available on github.

      <description>I am now trying out a Jekyll-based platform rather than a Wordpress based for my website and lab notebook. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, the Wordpress site still remains where it was with links intact, I&amp;rsquo;ve simply remapped the homepage. For now this is an experiment, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.
Why switch? Speed Wordpress was great, meeting most of my needs for a customizable site that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really accomplish in my first online notebook on OpenWetWare.</description>

      <description>Sweave is something of a gold standard in reproducible research. It creates a dynamic document, written in a mix of LaTeX and R code where the results of the analysis (numbers, figures, tables) are automatically generated from the code and inserted into the resulting pdf document, making them easy to update if the data or methods change. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice idea, in principle.
However, the practical troubles are many. Coauthors don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX, publishers who don&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX or pdfs.</description>

      <description>I am finding myself more and more drawn to markdown rather then tex/Rnw as my standard format (not least of which is the ease of displaying the files on github, particularly now that we have automatic image uploading). One thing I miss from latex is the citation commands.

      <description>I have recently modified the basic workflow of my lab notebook since discovering knitr. Before, I would write code files which I could track on github, push figures created by the code to flickr, and then write a notebook entry on wordpress describing what I was doing. I&amp;rsquo;d embed each figure I wanted into the entry, and each figure got an automatic link to github for the script that created it (which usually worked, though it didn&amp;rsquo;t say where in the script the command came from, and it required manually specifying the script name).</description>

It took me about 20 minutes to extend Yuhui&amp;rsquo;s interface to allow me to upload images through flickr instead of imgur, and embed them into a wordpress blog using the shortcode from the flickr gallery plugin.
To do this, I just modified the hook used by the markdown format. First, I define a quick R function that uploads to flickr and returns the flickr identifier number.</description>

      <description>Update: The original source file for this post, generates this output file formatted for wordpress. The source file has been knitted for markdown formatting so this post displays in Jekyll. The rendered post relies on Wordpress shortcodes, as raw the output file shows above. The markdown-based rendering shows the images and the shortcodes wordpress uses for codeblocks.
One of the great things about knitr is its flexibility. Here I set knitr up to publish to Wordpress.</description>

Noam and Jamie are leading the discussion, and suggested we pick a few favorite examples. None on my list really address the challenge of communicating uncertainty directly, though the first one probably comes closest. I think they do highlight some of the potential and the challenges of good data visualization though, which is certainly one of the essential building blocks to visual communication of uncertainty.</description>

Revealing Revisions Sharing version history is an important part of an open notebook really being open, and one reason why wikis have remained so popular for Open Notebook Science. Wordpress (this platform) does version management internally, and thepost-revision display plug-in makes this visible on posts. I had experimented but disabled this a while ago because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like visual impact of the long list at the end of my posts.</description>

      <description>An excellent question came up on ecoinformatics list today on data citation from Kyle Kwaiser at the Michigan Biological Station
 I am working with graduate students this summer to archive their work at our field station. I want to tell them to cite their datasets on their CV&amp;rsquo;s but I know this is not yet the norm.
 Any general thoughts on how close we are to including datasets on CV&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

      <description>Sebastian has started posting article reviews on his website, and invites us (Teary - our theoretical ecology tea mailing list) to do likewise. He uses a rather nifty Jabref converter to display the reviews created as bibtex entries, using the format indicated below.
These reviews are cross-posted from the reviews he (and associates) submit to Faculty of 1000, a commercial, subscription-based service. While this gives F1000 some publicity directly from his own site, it also means individuals can access these reviews freely.</description>

      <description>I thought I had already fixed this problem. I thought I already had a way to recover the code and parameter values of figures saved in my image log. Grab the SHA hash from the comment, go to the relevant repository on github, search the commit history for the commit, find the version of that file that was current at that time of commit (which could be in an earlier version if nothing had changed&amp;hellip;) and so forth&amp;hellip; Instead, I would catch myself re-running the code with parameters I knew (I&amp;rsquo;d scribble somewhere), just so I could be sure.</description>

      <description>Easiest way to share files is ssh onto the carlboettiger.info server, change into the directory carlboettiger.info/ and create a new directory there &amp;ndash; i.e. share/. This behaves as a regular static webpage directory that will list the files provided.
Secure access can be created by going to the goodies &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;htaccess/WebDav page and selecting the option to make a directory or subdirectory secure, and then specifying the passwords, etc. Have created the subdirectory http://carlboettiger.</description>

 that&amp;rsquo;s probably NCEAS&amp;rsquo; biggest legacy-the sense that the answers to all, or at least many, of our questions are already out there, in existing data that just needs to be pulled together&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Adding mathjax by modifying the header.php file in my wordpress theme, as recommended by MathJax website, isn&amp;rsquo;t stable to upgrades of the theme, which simply replace the header.php file with a fresh version. The &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; way to do this is using child themes, which are pretty simple, even though this got me writing my first php functions.
 Create a directory in wp-content/themes with the desired name of the new theme.</description>

      <description>What would a semantic lab notebook look like? What would be possible with such a structure, ideally? What is already possible now? There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that can be done with an electronic notebook that adds value over a paper notebook: browsing by categories and tags, embedding links, time-stamping entries, searching the full text, and having automated trackbacks or pingbacks when a post is mentioned in another post or appears elsewhere on the web.</description>

      <description>What follows are my notes from May 6th, 2011 expressing the ideas that would ultimately coalesce into the rOpenSci project. Much of this was turned into an email to Duncan and Todd, whose feedback was invaluable in working through this, and several others. (The reference to SI2 refers to an NSF call from about that time, which also stimulated my thinking on this matter.) Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit about these tools, with which I now feel quite comfortable.</description>

      <description>Started to implement the Mendeley API in R, with much help and guidance from Prof. Duncan Temple-Lang in the Stats dept. R is a widely used statistical software environment, and this should facilitate real-time statistical analysis of the rich amount of publication data available in Mendeley.
My motivation is primarily pedagogical at the moment- Mendeley seems to have a nice modern API with both public and authentication-required elements (using OAuth). Writing out the API gives me some good practice making GET requests in RCURL and handling JSON returns, and experiencing the bumps that go with this kind of work.</description>

      <description>Reading Taking twenty minutes to take down some notes and reactions to this morning&amp;rsquo;s reading.
Interdisciplinary Science Meeting Great post by the AAAS on theScience on FIRE meeting. Think the focus on young faculty and undergraduate education is dead on. However , the lack of emphasis (or even inclusion) of ecology and evolution material in &amp;ldquo;exemplar programs&amp;rdquo; such as CIMB (not be confused with UC Davis&amp;rsquo;s CLIMB, which does this balance very well) is tragic, given that (a) these fields have a richer and longer quantitative history than mol bio, (b) undergraduate ed in these areas shares the same general lack of emphasis in computation and mathematics skills as it&amp;rsquo;s molecular brethren classes &amp;copy; world challenges in these areas are at least on par with challenges in medicine, and deserve attention (despite the differences in funding).</description>

      <description>A few small updates on my socialR package, (continued from my earlier entries) which should hopefully help it evolve from a personal tool to a portable package one day. Starting by incorporating support for native R packages to handle the API interface to flickr, twitter, and github, rather than just calling command-line scripts. Jeff Gentry has just released an ROAuth package for authentication, which can be used by his twitteR package.</description>

from unknown, 2010, which provides a great basis for recommendations to authors, publishers, and funders to ensure reproducible research. Victoria Stodden describes two journals with Open Review and two with Associate Editors of Reproducible Research.

      <description>Talking with Nick a bit about the socialR package, hope to find a chance to streamline the package a bit, move away from all system calls and interface directly with the APIs for Flickr, twitter, etc from R. This should avoid the command-line program dependencies and configurations I need to use currently.
Building my own API interfaces looks like it will require a good bit of work, meanwhile significant hope the community might develop reasonable packages to pull this off &amp;ndash; basic packages already exist for twitter and flickr.</description>

      <description>On Thursday I silently switched my ONS claim from all-content, instant (aci) to all-content, delayed (acd). This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just an admission that I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes a day behind in posting my entries. That day&amp;rsquo;s post was tagged private in wordpress, and didn&amp;rsquo;t appear in the RSS feed. I updated my socialR package to include a toggle to make uploaded images from public to private, and opened a private github repository. No, nothing tragic has happened and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that everything I do will now be locked down until publication.</description>

      <description>I agree that the key is open data, and it really only helps if that data is discoverable, and better if it&amp;rsquo;s in a central repository. The open notebook community is pretty focused on figuring out ways to automate and link the data from the notebook. For instance, many solubilities recorded for chemicals given in wikipedia automatically link to the open notebook entries describing the experiment wherein the data was collected, check out http://en.</description>

Cloud Computing An interesting package was announced over the r-sig-hpc list today, creating an arbitrarily large Hadoop cluster out of Amazon EC2 instances directly from the R command line. JD Long has been very responsive to my naive questions on setting it up, so I was able to quickly activate an Elastic Map Reduce account via Amazon Web Services and run the example code.</description>

So in the spirit of year-in-review reflections, here&amp;rsquo;s my development from the past year (just for the phylogenetic statistics work).
Quality is a little too poor to read file names, more entertaining than practical. Other user icons appear in December corresponding with my move to running the code from Amazon cloud.</description>

      <description>This evening I&amp;rsquo;m testing extensions to find a better way to include citations in my entries. Thus far I&amp;rsquo;ve use Mendeley&amp;rsquo;s convenient copy-paste citation tool to paste the whole citation in, which I suppose could work reasonably smoothly with the nice footnotes plugin I recently adopted. However, this still requires a couple more steps than I need to cite in my LaTeX text editor or in OpenOffice.
Using the papercite plugin, I can add citations to posts in much the same way that I add them to my latex documents, using the citation key created Mendeley when it makes my bibtex file.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created an R package that uses social media tools for reproducible research. The goal of the package is this: whenever I run a code, output figures are automatically added to my figure repository (Flickr), linked to the timestamped version of the code that produced them in the code repository. Figures should be tagged by project and be embedded selectively or automatically into this lab notebook. The basic workflow of the notebook looks like this:[ref]Diagram of my notebook as presented at Science Online, 2011, see other slides in my entry on this.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on the New Policies for Data Archiving at NSF and in Common Journals</title>

      <description>This post is a work in progress, a scratch pad for me to start assembling what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about and resources pertaining to the new policies emerging from NSF and journals relevant to ecology and evolution. Hoping to highlight not only the policies, but the issues, opportunities, and concerns around them.
I am hoping to help organize a workshop to discuss these issues in my department this Winter. The Davis Open Science group, is planning a series of these workshops, hoping to work with departments, the libraries and the UC Davis Office of Research and its Responsible Conduct of Research  program (in compliance with NIH/NSF ethics requirements), as well as resident faculty and editors.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m running quite a few of my analyses on my remote server, a 16 core, 32 GB ram, Ubuntu server with Tesla GPU, named &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; (we&amp;rsquo;re creative folks). It&amp;rsquo;s easy to start lots of simulations (from ssh), harder to track when they are finished and verify results. No longer &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; now uses social media to share what she&amp;rsquo;s up to. Find her on twitter: @tweeting_cpu

      <description>Interesting discussion of a Lenski paper in Wainwright&amp;rsquo;s 270.
Barrick, J.E. et al. Genome evolution and adaptation in a long-term experiment with Escherichia coli. Nature 461, 1243-7(2009).
Seems to focus on surprise of continuing linear rate of increase in beneficial mutations, though statistics don&amp;rsquo;t seem to confirm. Curious about uncertainty in assay of fitness estimates (seem to go down at times, but surely not fixing deleterious mutations). General difficulties in setup of exponential growth with applications of classic constant population size, but maybe we&amp;rsquo;re all missing something.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Not a Blog Welcome to my open lab notebook. This is the active, permanent record of all my scientific research, standing in place of the traditional bound lab notebook. It is a record of ideas, and intuitions; results and mistakes. Please bear in mind that the notebook is primarily a tool for me to do science, not communicate it. I write my entries with the hope that they are intelligible to my future self; and maybe intelligible to my collaborators and experts in my field.</description>

      <description>Read through the article for Monday&amp;rsquo;s PBG270, a 2009 Nature paper from the Plotkin lab on mutational robustness and the rate of evolution. They consider an interesting little setup. Start with a Moran model (individual born, may mutate, choses who to replace at random), but allow the following mutational structure (landscape). Of P possible genotypes, each can only move to one of K neighbors by a single mutation. Call the genotype(s) of optimal fitness C.</description>

      <description>Wrote yesterday&amp;rsquo;s entry on power spectral analysis difficulties from yesterday. Why don&amp;rsquo;t I remember my physics training better? Bialek&amp;rsquo;s Phy562 notes still very helpful. No one else seems to write about this stuff clearly enough for me. Including me. 8a-11a
Catching up on reading. Good news and discussion items in Nature on publishing code and review materials, excellent piece on climate change scientists engaging media, climate high performance computing in Brazil; etc see headlines and links in my twitter feed archive for today.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag of activities. Finished a journal review, comments confidential, recorded in my reviewed papers archive. I then organized documents library (more below) and then back to paper revisions.
The reference manager software Mendeley recently upgraded the way it handles groups and sharing, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to revise how it impacts my workflow around articles. Articles can be organized into folders (collections) or kept unsorted within the library, and can be part of as multiple collections.</description>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden. The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump. The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>I strive for a transparent and reproducible research process. My lab notebooks are kept on an open wiki (via OpenWetWare). I curate the literature I read into several public lists (Mendeley), maintain my research source code and simulations on a collective database for open source development (Github), and am active on academic forums and mailing lists. These web-based tools make a largely automated, interlinked archive of my work I can search, update and share easily.</description>
