      <description>I am trying out Jekyll as an alternative to Wordpress for powering this site and my open lab notebook. If you subscribe, the new RSS (atom) feed for the new notebook is at http://carlboettiger.info/atom.xml. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any feedback, good or bad, about the switch. A recent post gives my own reflections. The site&amp;rsquo;s source-code is available on github.

      <description>Sweave is something of a gold standard in reproducible research. It creates a dynamic document, written in a mix of LaTeX and R code where the results of the analysis (numbers, figures, tables) are automatically generated from the code and inserted into the resulting pdf document, making them easy to update if the data or methods change. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice idea, in principle.
However, the practical troubles are many. Coauthors don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX, publishers who don&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX or pdfs.</description>

      <description>I am finding myself more and more drawn to markdown rather then tex/Rnw as my standard format (not least of which is the ease of displaying the files on github, particularly now that we have automatic image uploading). One thing I miss from latex is the citation commands. (I understand these can be provided to markdown via Pandoc, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to simply have to knit the document, and not then run it through pandoc, latex, or another interpreter).</description>

      <description>I have recently modified the basic workflow of my lab notebook since discovering knitr. Before, I would write code files which I could track on github, push figures created by the code to flickr, and then write a notebook entry on wordpress describing what I was doing. I&amp;rsquo;d embed each figure I wanted into the entry, and each figure got an automatic link to github for the script that created it (which usually worked, though it didn&amp;rsquo;t say where in the script the command came from, and it required manually specifying the script name).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not always careful in citing all the R packages I use. R actually has some rather nice built-in mechanisms to support this, so I really have no excuse. Here&amp;rsquo;s some quick examples:

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how nice it is to work with well-developed software. It took me about 20 minutes to extend Yuhui&amp;rsquo;s interface to allow me to upload images through flickr instead of imgur, and embed them into a wordpress blog using the shortcode from the flickr gallery plugin.
To do this, I just modified the hook used by the markdown format. First, I define a quick R function that uploads to flickr and returns the flickr identifier number.</description>

      <description>Update: The original source file for this post, generates this output file formatted for wordpress. The source file has been knitted for markdown formatting so this post displays in Jekyll. The rendered post relies on Wordpress shortcodes, as raw the output file shows above. The markdown-based rendering shows the images and the shortcodes wordpress uses for codeblocks.
One of the great things about knitr is its flexibility. Here I set knitr up to publish to Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Visiting the question of communicating uncertainty in Marissa&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting, focusing on this excellent Science article (Spiegelhalter et. al. 2011). Noam and Jamie are leading the discussion, and suggested we pick a few favorite examples. None on my list really address the challenge of communicating uncertainty directly, though the first one probably comes closest. I think they do highlight some of the potential and the challenges of good data visualization though, which is certainly one of the essential building blocks to visual communication of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>My software wants to be free. It wants to be seen and used and loved by as many people as possible. When first it heard of open source licenses, it set sail to join the company of great software in the promised land, but finding true freedom has been a tortured journey.
In the clutches of the GPL Created and defended by the Free Software Foundation and used by such venerable institutions as the Linux Kernel, the gcc compiler, and the R statistical environment, the GNU&amp;rsquo;s General Public License seemed like a gold standard to call home.</description>

      <description>This question invariably comes up at some point in any discussion of open notebook science. This concern is usually voiced in reference to the high-visibility magazines, which many scientists seem to assume will have very restrictive conditions. A quick read of their policies shows otherwise. Here are the links to pre-publication policies of major journals, with my short summaries &amp;amp; comments.

      <description>The highlight package is a simple solution for very nice syntax highlighted code boxes in latex documents. Requires switching the driver, which is best done from within R and requires creating a makefile though. Needs the &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo; package installed. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple makefile.

      <description>What follows is a collection of notes, examples, and reflections I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write down.
Revealing Revisions Sharing version history is an important part of an open notebook really being open, and one reason why wikis have remained so popular for Open Notebook Science. Wordpress (this platform) does version management internally, and thepost-revision display plug-in makes this visible on posts. I had experimented but disabled this a while ago because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like visual impact of the long list at the end of my posts.</description>

 I am working with graduate students this summer to archive their work at our field station. I want to tell them to cite their datasets on their CV&amp;rsquo;s but I know this is not yet the norm.
 Any general thoughts on how close we are to including datasets on CV&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

      <description>Sebastian has started posting article reviews on his website, and invites us (Teary - our theoretical ecology tea mailing list) to do likewise. He uses a rather nifty Jabref converter to display the reviews created as bibtex entries, using the format indicated below.
These reviews are cross-posted from the reviews he (and associates) submit to Faculty of 1000, a commercial, subscription-based service. While this gives F1000 some publicity directly from his own site, it also means individuals can access these reviews freely.</description>

Grab the SHA hash from the comment, go to the relevant repository on github, search the commit history for the commit, find the version of that file that was current at that time of commit (which could be in an earlier version if nothing had changed&amp;hellip;) and so forth&amp;hellip; Instead, I would catch myself re-running the code with parameters I knew (I&amp;rsquo;d scribble somewhere), just so I could be sure.</description>

      <description>Easiest way to share files is ssh onto the carlboettiger.info server, change into the directory carlboettiger.info/ and create a new directory there &amp;ndash; i.e. share/. This behaves as a regular static webpage directory that will list the files provided.
Secure access can be created by going to the goodies &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;htaccess/WebDav page and selecting the option to make a directory or subdirectory secure, and then specifying the passwords, etc. Have created the subdirectory http://carlboettiger.</description>

      <description>Adding mathjax by modifying the header.php file in my wordpress theme, as recommended by MathJax website, isn&amp;rsquo;t stable to upgrades of the theme, which simply replace the header.php file with a fresh version. The &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; way to do this is using child themes, which are pretty simple, even though this got me writing my first php functions.
 Create a directory in wp-content/themes with the desired name of the new theme.</description>

      <description>What would a semantic lab notebook look like? What would be possible with such a structure, ideally? What is already possible now? There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that can be done with an electronic notebook that adds value over a paper notebook: browsing by categories and tags, embedding links, time-stamping entries, searching the full text, and having automated trackbacks or pingbacks when a post is mentioned in another post or appears elsewhere on the web.</description>

      <description>What follows are my notes from May 6th, 2011 expressing the ideas that would ultimately coalesce into the rOpenSci project. Much of this was turned into an email to Duncan and Todd, whose feedback was invaluable in working through this, and several others. (The reference to SI2 refers to an NSF call from about that time, which also stimulated my thinking on this matter.) Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit about these tools, with which I now feel quite comfortable.</description>

      <title>Mendeley API in R</title>

      <description>Started to implement the Mendeley API in R, with much help and guidance from Prof. Duncan Temple-Lang in the Stats dept. R is a widely used statistical software environment, and this should facilitate real-time statistical analysis of the rich amount of publication data available in Mendeley.
My motivation is primarily pedagogical at the moment- Mendeley seems to have a nice modern API with both public and authentication-required elements (using OAuth). Writing out the API gives me some good practice making GET requests in RCURL and handling JSON returns, and experiencing the bumps that go with this kind of work.</description>

      <description>Reading Taking twenty minutes to take down some notes and reactions to this morning&amp;rsquo;s reading.
Interdisciplinary Science Meeting Great post by the AAAS on theScience on FIRE meeting. Think the focus on young faculty and undergraduate education is dead on. However , the lack of emphasis (or even inclusion) of ecology and evolution material in &amp;ldquo;exemplar programs&amp;rdquo; such as CIMB (not be confused with UC Davis&amp;rsquo;s CLIMB, which does this balance very well) is tragic, given that (a) these fields have a richer and longer quantitative history than mol bio, (b) undergraduate ed in these areas shares the same general lack of emphasis in computation and mathematics skills as it&amp;rsquo;s molecular brethren classes &amp;copy; world challenges in these areas are at least on par with challenges in medicine, and deserve attention (despite the differences in funding).</description>

      <description>A few small updates on my socialR package, (continued from my earlier entries) which should hopefully help it evolve from a personal tool to a portable package one day. Starting by incorporating support for native R packages to handle the API interface to flickr, twitter, and github, rather than just calling command-line scripts. Jeff Gentry has just released an ROAuth package for authentication, which can be used by his twitteR package.</description>

from unknown, 2010, which provides a great basis for recommendations to authors, publishers, and funders to ensure reproducible research. Victoria Stodden describes two journals with Open Review and two with Associate Editors of Reproducible Research.

      <description>Talking with Nick a bit about the socialR package, hope to find a chance to streamline the package a bit, move away from all system calls and interface directly with the APIs for Flickr, twitter, etc from R. This should avoid the command-line program dependencies and configurations I need to use currently.
Building my own API interfaces looks like it will require a good bit of work, meanwhile significant hope the community might develop reasonable packages to pull this off &amp;ndash; basic packages already exist for twitter and flickr.</description>

      <description>On Thursday I silently switched my ONS claim from all-content, instant (aci) to all-content, delayed (acd). This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just an admission that I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes a day behind in posting my entries. That day&amp;rsquo;s post was tagged private in wordpress, and didn&amp;rsquo;t appear in the RSS feed. I updated my socialR package to include a toggle to make uploaded images from public to private, and opened a private github repository. No, nothing tragic has happened and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that everything I do will now be locked down until publication.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of rapid development in scientific tools based on a Wordpress platform recently, perhaps spurred in part by the recent Beyond-the-PDF and sessions in Science Online conferences. A new discussion group has emerged around these tools, as described by Martin Fenner.
I have been exploring better tools for citation management within my lab notebook. Recently I have been using the papercite plugin to add citations from my BibTeX files, which are generated from Mendeley, as I described earlier.</description>

      <description>I agree that the key is open data, and it really only helps if that data is discoverable, and better if it&amp;rsquo;s in a central repository. The open notebook community is pretty focused on figuring out ways to automate and link the data from the notebook. For instance, many solubilities recorded for chemicals given in wikipedia automatically link to the open notebook entries describing the experiment wherein the data was collected, check out http://en.</description>

Cloud Computing An interesting package was announced over the r-sig-hpc list today, creating an arbitrarily large Hadoop cluster out of Amazon EC2 instances directly from the R command line. JD Long has been very responsive to my naive questions on setting it up, so I was able to quickly activate an Elastic Map Reduce account via Amazon Web Services and run the example code.</description>

So in the spirit of year-in-review reflections, here&amp;rsquo;s my development from the past year (just for the phylogenetic statistics work).
Quality is a little too poor to read file names, more entertaining than practical. Other user icons appear in December corresponding with my move to running the code from Amazon cloud.</description>

      <description>This evening I&amp;rsquo;m testing extensions to find a better way to include citations in my entries. Thus far I&amp;rsquo;ve use Mendeley&amp;rsquo;s convenient copy-paste citation tool to paste the whole citation in, which I suppose could work reasonably smoothly with the nice footnotes plugin I recently adopted. However, this still requires a couple more steps than I need to cite in my LaTeX text editor or in OpenOffice.
Using the papercite plugin, I can add citations to posts in much the same way that I add them to my latex documents, using the citation key created Mendeley when it makes my bibtex file.</description>

I am hoping to help organize a workshop to discuss these issues in my department this Winter. The Davis Open Science group, is planning a series of these workshops, hoping to work with departments, the libraries and the UC Davis Office of Research and its Responsible Conduct of Research  program (in compliance with NIH/NSF ethics requirements), as well as resident faculty and editors.</description>

Barrick, J.E. et al. Genome evolution and adaptation in a long-term experiment with Escherichia coli. Nature 461, 1243-7(2009).
Seems to focus on surprise of continuing linear rate of increase in beneficial mutations, though statistics don&amp;rsquo;t seem to confirm. Curious about uncertainty in assay of fitness estimates (seem to go down at times, but surely not fixing deleterious mutations). General difficulties in setup of exponential growth with applications of classic constant population size, but maybe we&amp;rsquo;re all missing something.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag of activities. Finished a journal review, comments confidential, recorded in my reviewed papers archive. I then organized documents library (more below) and then back to paper revisions.
The reference manager software Mendeley recently upgraded the way it handles groups and sharing, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to revise how it impacts my workflow around articles. Articles can be organized into folders (collections) or kept unsorted within the library, and can be part of as multiple collections.</description>

      <title>Wrong picture, wrong model: why warning signals don&#39;t look like rare events</title>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden. The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump. The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>I strive for a transparent and reproducible research process. My lab notebooks are kept on an open wiki (via OpenWetWare). I curate the literature I read into several public lists (Mendeley), maintain my research source code and simulations on a collective database for open source development (Github), and am active on academic forums and mailing lists. These web-based tools make a largely automated, interlinked archive of my work I can search, update and share easily.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a recent bugfix in the exitwp scripts I was able to export all my Wordpress entries. The script pulls the entries from the Wordpress database and formats them in markdown, along with extracting all metadata such as timestamp, tags, categories, publication status, and Wordpress id number, which are all embedded as YAML header information.
Why migrate the old entries? When I moved to the Jekyll notebook, I left the Wordpress site standing with all its existing content and simply remapped the home pages.</description>

      <description>Misc  Mostly writing application today&amp;hellip; Review for EcoLet looking over pomdp/momdp
 Notebook archives now on figshare (plain-txt versions). Can now also cite entries by doi, e.g.: Lab Notebook (2010) doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.96916, and Lab Notebook, (2011) doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.96919. Would publishing individual entries and individual figshare objects be preferable or just annoying?

      <description>I enjoyed an excellent meeting with Annette Thomas, CEO of MacMillian Publishing and Nature Publishing group at UC Davis. It was impressive to here that Annette wanted to meet with UC Davis faculty and graduate students interested in open access and open science to discuss our opinions, desires and frustrations in the scientific publishing process. It was particularly valuable to discuss some of the failed experiments in open science at Nature.</description>

      <description>From Thursday Nov 1 through Saturday Nov 3 I attended the PLoS Altmetrics workshop as a member of the ROpensci project. An exciting meeting driven mostly by the opportunity to interact with a small and incredibly creative and innovative group of science publishers, funders, start-ups, and other researchers. Details of the event are largely recorded on the altmetrics 2012 workshop website. We also have a few slides addressing the ropensci slant.</description>

      <description>C. Titus Brown has an excellent post discussing his exploration into the merits and technicalities cross-posting his blog posts to figshare. The rfigshare package written by Ted Hart and myself can do just this, once we puzzled out some of the same challenges (Notes to Titus: though the documentation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention it, you can get a programmatic list of available categories from http://api.figshare.com/v1/categories. Figshare can also take code as a fileset or dataset, and may soon add a type for it.</description>

      <description>At home after birth of Edward since Jan 19th, leaving little time for research. Assembled notes from a few side projects I&amp;rsquo;ve moved forward in the wee hours. Covers the past several days.
XML and RDFa parsing I have been using the lab notebook to explore technology for scientific communication, including making use of semantic and linked data concepts. To illustrate some of the potential these tools can offer I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a short post with examples parsing and exploring the XML and RDFa data in the notebook.</description>

      <description>Meeting with Marc Selection of problem: consider simpler models only. Sep through complexity hierarchy at the beginning:
 classical approaches are to fix relationship of stock recruitment.
 parameter uncertainty Gaussian processes for model uncertainty  The Discussion section can deal with model uncertainty model choice approaches.
 A method where we don&amp;rsquo;t have to assume the stock recuritment relationship How well we can do with that.
 How much data we need.</description>

      <description>Mendeley API for Jekyll Finally finished off my Mendeley API for Jekyll (The top uses the Ruby API implementation from Michael Bus, copied here since it is not yet provided as a gem. scroll to the bottom for my plugin code). The Mendeley API implementation is remarkably clumsy. For instance, rather than allowing queries to the API that specify a user&amp;rsquo;s folder and a sort-by field, we are forced to first query the folder for a list of IDs and then query document details on every document in the folder, after which we can sort locally.</description>

      <description>Exploring the use of automated feeds in my notebook entries, which would make writing posts both faster and more complete. I had recently modified my Jekyll plugins to include commits on the day of the post. Consequently, I could add a bit of liquid code to any post, such as:
{% raw %}
{% octokit_commits pdg_control%}  {% endraw %}
(or even to the post template) and have the commit log for the specified repository automatically imported.</description>

      <description>As the lab notebook grows, to make the maximum use of content it would be particularly useful to maximize the ability for a computer to understand the content, allowing us to identify, manipulate, and connect data using scripts and software. This is the concept of linked data, or a semantic notebook. I have explored this this idea before in the context of a wordpress-based platform, but now that Jekyll has let me strip away some of the abstraction of Wordpress it seems a good time to revisit this idea.</description>

      <title>Solarized Colors with Twitter-Bootstrap?</title>

      <description>Trying out rendering my notebook using Ethan Schoonover&amp;rsquo;s Solarized color scheme. The solarized palette has been selected according to Ethan&amp;rsquo;s exacting standards for contrast, symmetry, and readability.
My site CSS is built with Twitter-Bootstrap, which uses LESS to generate CSS files. Normal CSS is valid LESS code too, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the concept of a variable. So changing colors in CSS requires changing each and every occurance of some hex colorcode.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Note that this package has evolved quite a bit from this initial post. While the basic interface is the same, support for additional features and some choices in formatting differ from what is presented here. Please see the README for the latest introduction to the package. Readers may also be interested in the more recent post discussing the introduction of several new features including semantic tools in the knitcitations package</description>
