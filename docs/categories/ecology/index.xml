      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just been accepted to the Data to Knowledge Conference in Berkeley this May. I think this conference will address some of the key issues facing us in Big Data today across many different fields, and I hope to learn much that could be useful to ecology and evolution. Given the audience I look forward to being a source of questions rather than answers as I put on my biologist&amp;rsquo;s cap.</description>

      <description>Markdown over latex? knitr may have solved the fundamental challenge of all Sweave/latex users with Markdown. Too many of us must be able to work with collaborators who don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX and journals that won&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX. It&amp;rsquo;s a sad state of the affairs, and has improved slowly for journals (at least many will take pdfs for initial submissions) if not for collaborators. Consequently getting away from LaTeX would be nice, but Word or Google docs just won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>

      <guid>/2012/03/26/active-adaptive-management-solutions-belief-sdp.html</guid>
      <description>Have finally gotten my active adaptive management solutions working.
The active adaptive management solution learns very quickly and rather monotonically which model is correct, even when models differ by small amounts and the initial belief is heavily skewed to the wrong model. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented examples with Myers model, but in this parameter space the allee effect is well below the Reed escapement level of the alternative Beverton Holt model, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exert itself.</description>

      <description>Ecologists/TREE (Fischer et. al. 2009), (Polasky et. al. 2011) give a nice overview/introduction to the problem. Perhaps most interestingly, both set up resilience approaches as a foil or alternate approach in contrast to a decision-theoretic problem. Fischer&amp;rsquo;s group does a particularly nice job handling the case that these two are separate approaches &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dismiss resilience thinking as fuzzy optimization of fuzzy objective functions.
The Polasky piece does a nice job refocusing us on the obvious but brushed-over question of the objective function.</description>

      <description>A central question of training problem 1b addressed at the working group was how to compare the different penalties. Following up on those discussions, here are a few notes on how far I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in the analysis regarding the best way to make these comparisons.
 simulate_npv_curves Nice job of showing the performance of the variance ratio, clear example for L2. Correlation test should probably be applied to differences, pattern is much less clear.</description>

      <description>Spent way more of today than I wanted to hammering out the active adaptive management implementation for a trivial model-choice problem using the discretized belief-SDP approach.
We have alternate models $f_1$ and $f2$ of the state equations (population growth dynamics) $$ x{t+1} = z_t f(x_t) $$ and introduce a continuously valued belief probability $p$ that model 1 is correct. This lends itself to a Bayesian updating rule for our belief based on observing a transition from $x$ to $y$,</description>

Next: Uncertainty = we can learn and hence decrease the uncertainty. But state-space grows exponentially.

      <description>Notes from Alex Pfaff talk at UTK (during my visit for pdg-control meeting).
 average impact vs differential impact &amp;ndash; must compare against what would have happened to the area if unprotected (at current time/short-timescale, or in future?)
 Proximity is not a good proxy of similarity (i.e. bc we protect steep slopes but farm the flat land nearby)
 Instead use simple metrics available in GIS layers - distance from nearest road, etc.</description>

      <description>In this example, we compute the distribution of the stability coefficients estimated from the fished and unfished simulations. Overall this shows little success in distinguishing between the stability of the fished and unfished populations &amp;ndash; i.e. no hint that we are managing near an edge.

      <description>Trivial example of a non-optimal but more robust policy by editing the optimal strategy directly. Note in particular that this outperforms the optimal strategy economically as well as ecologically (fewer crashed populations).
 Running the policy-costs model with Beverton Holt instead of the Myers function seems to give a clearer picture of a system responding to policy costs. The single-replicate picture probably captures this better than the policy/replicate visualizations.</description>

      <description>Visiting the question of communicating uncertainty in Marissa&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting, focusing on this excellent Science article (Spiegelhalter et. al. 2011). Noam and Jamie are leading the discussion, and suggested we pick a few favorite examples. None on my list really address the challenge of communicating uncertainty directly, though the first one probably comes closest. I think they do highlight some of the potential and the challenges of good data visualization though, which is certainly one of the essential building blocks to visual communication of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Submitted my abstract for ESA 2012, in Portland. Getting a title and abstract pinned down about seven months in advance is itself an exercise in decision making under uncertainty. I&amp;rsquo;ve added some further background below.
Unknown unknowns: management strategies under uncertainty &amp;amp; alternate stable states Background/Question/Methods The effective management of natural resource populations such as fisheries or forests and the ecosystems in which they are embedded is a central goal of much work in both theoretical and applied ecological research.</description>

      <description>Surprising heterogeneity of profit distribution under a simple Beverton-Holt model Usually I expect the alternate stable state dynamics to be the ones producing bimodal distribution of profit:
The pattern is driven by a costs to harvesting making harvest unprofitable most of the time, while chance fluctuations push some populations across this threshold again and again. The ensemble variation in harvest is suggestive of this:
but we really see what is going on when we color-code the population dynamics of the most profitable and least profitable realizations of the stochastic dynamics:</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve simulated 1000 replicates of a system that has alternative stable states, but is not approaching the bifurcation. I&amp;rsquo;ve added enough noise (demographic stochasticity in this case, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what) that 129&amp;frasl;1000 transition stochastically to the bad state, so I have decent sample sizes in each. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m finding: If I condition on having crashed (i.e. take the 129 that transition) and apply our model-based early warning signal, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t detect any early warning sign.</description>

      <description>Greatly enjoyed seeing this perspective on power laws (Stumpf &amp;amp; Porter, 2012) Or as Richard McElreath put even more concisely,
 People get amazed by power laws but never by normal distributions. Seems like some max ent outcomes astonish while others don&amp;rsquo;t. When so many mechanisms aggregate to common densities, I&amp;rsquo;d hope we&amp;rsquo;d stop trying to argue that we can go backwards from pattern to process so easily.

      <description>Abstract The recog­ni­tion that ecosys­tems can undergo sud­den shifts to alter­nate, less desir­able sta­ble states has led to the desire to iden­tify early warn­ing signs of these impend­ing col­lapses. Motivated by the math­e­mat­ics of bifur­ca­tions, the search for early warn­ing signs seeks to detect subtle patterns that may precede these shift. Faced with limited and imperfect data, such forecasting is fraught with uncertainty. I will present work illustrating how we can quantify the risks of false alarms and missed detection of these early warning signals, and illustrate how this information can be used to inform robust decision-making that may avoid collapse.</description>

      <description>The optimal policy with symmetric L1 costs to changing the quotas results in the solutions that stop changing, sometimes at no harvest (if there&amp;rsquo;s scrap value), or at some fixed high harvest if no scrap value. (See earlier notes). Asymmetric costs of comparable magnitude result in more crashes.
When we apply an L1 norm cost of the same magnitude as before for decreasing quotas, but allow increasing quotas to be free (no cost to environmental lobby), the solution follows the Reed optimum is in purple (harvest_alt) (cost-free adjustment), while the blue is the harvest level being implemented with a cost:</description>

If you compute some objects in the plot function (stats etc), those stats are not stored by the object (due to lazy evaluation, usually a very nice time-saving feature), so the plot cannot be produced unless the function returns those things to the global environment (or from wherever the plot will be printed/evaluated).</description>

      <description>Considering the case where there is a cost to changing the harvest quota (representing the cost of efforts to change policy). We can imagine several scenarios that could introduce this:
 Fixed cost to change
 Cost proportional to the size of the change (L1 norm)
 Cost proportional to the square of the size (L2 norm, i.e. small changes aren&amp;rsquo;t expensive, large ones are very expensive)
 asymmetric costs &amp;ndash; lowering quotas may be harder than raising them</description>

      <description>Control &amp;amp; Optimization Dominique Bonvin visit  two-step control (optimize parameters, optimize mean-square error between model and measurement also by parameter adjustment) fails when reality isn&amp;rsquo;t in the model set. Problem is under-determined (N free variables, 4N equations). (converges, but onto the wrong optimum).
 Better solution &amp;ndash; adjust the penalty/regularization terms to to get better agreement between model and data
 Bonvin approach &amp;ndash; adjust the control instead (NCO Control).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now computing the optimal solution under three sources of noise (compare with my earlier examples of calculating the optimal solution assuming only growth noise, but simulating dynamics with other noise sources). See the statement of problem details, essentially:
$$ \max_{ { q_t } \leq 0 } \mathbb{E} \left{ \sum_0^{\infty} \alpha^t h_t \right} $$ s.t. Fish population follows: $ x_t = zt^g f( x{t-1} - h_{t-1} ) $ and measured stock is given by: $ m_t = z_t^m x_t $ while harvest is: $ h_t = \min (x_t, z_t^i q_t) $ Where $ z^g $ denotes uncertainty in population growth, $ z^m $ denotes uncertainty in measurement for the stock assessment, and $ z^i $ denotes uncertainty in harvest implementation.</description>

      <description>Adding stochasticity seems to have a small history.
Reed 1979 Reed, 1979 Uncertainty in next year&amp;rsquo;s stock, &amp;ldquo;growth uncertainty&amp;rdquo; at the time of determining harvest. Constant escapement policy, no chance of extinction.
Clark &amp;amp; Kirkwood 1986 Clark &amp;amp; Kirkwood, 1986 Uncertainty in this year&amp;rsquo;s stock, &amp;ldquo;measurement uncertainty&amp;rdquo; when determining harvest.
Roughgarden &amp;amp; Smith (1996) consider both, and add uncertainty in harvest. Sethi et al. 2005 (Sethi et. al. 2005) consider the economist&amp;rsquo;s optimization of this.</description>

      <description>I consider the optimal stochastic-dynamic programming solution for the model specified with known stochasticity in population dynamics, but now vary the actual simulated dynamics to include further uncertainty or error not included in the optimal solution in different ways. In some way this is an &amp;ldquo;unfair&amp;rdquo; analysis, as I really should be solving for the optimal solution in light of the fully uncertain space, but in practice this at least serves as a sensitivity analysis to the assumptions that certain quantities are perfectly known.</description>

      <description>Modeling choices Allee effect model: Myers Beverton-Holt with harvesting-effort mortality:
$$ x_{t+1} = f(x) = \frac{a x_t^{\alpha}}{1+ x_t^{\alpha}/b} - e x $$ For $ \alpha = 2 $, equilibrium points are $ x = 0 $ and
$$ x = \frac{ab}{2(1+e)} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left(\frac{ab}{1+e}\right)^2-4b } $$
As written this differs from our earlier solutions a couple respects &amp;ndash; the growth function applies to the unharvested population, which then experiences harvesting mortality, and the control variable is fishing effort, not harvest.</description>

      <description>Dakos (Dakos et. al. 2012) considers $ \tfrac{dx}{dt} = f(x,p) $ and perturbs the parameter randomly to introduce variation. Evaluating around an equilibrium where $ f(x^, p^) = 0 $, they expand to first order (citing (Ripa &amp;amp; Heino, 1999)):
$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \partial_x f(x^,p^)(x-x^) + \partial_p f(x^,p^) (p - p^) $$
and taking $ \xi = x- x^* $, with some slight of hand argue this can be rewritten as an Ito process,</description>

      <description>Starting with Reed 1979 Reed, 1979. Consider the stochastic population growth model
$$ X_{t+1} = Z_n f(X_n) $$
$ f(x) $ is concave and non-decreasing (compensating, not over-compensating). A natural choice is the Beverton-Holt model,
$$ f(x) = \frac{A x}{1+B x} $$
Cost of harvest is Schaefer production function $ c(x) = k/q x $, (i.e. doubling fish density halves the cost, assume $q $ constant), or Cobbs-Douglas form $ c(x) = k/x^{\theta} $ where $ \theta = 1+\beta \leq 1$.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We consider the stochastic optimal control problem of fisheries harvests under the scenarios involving alternate stable states, with uncertainty about the parameters of harvest. We consider a series of introductory problems to prepare us for the full problem. We begin with classical optimal control approaches (Pontraygin&amp;rsquo;s principle to transform into an ordinary differential equation boundary-value problem) for continuous time state equations (fish population dynamics) as a reference point.</description>

      <description>Discrete-time state equation Discrete-time solution appears to be all about dynamic programming
and a chance for me to remember that I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice writing recursive functions. It&amp;rsquo;s just that in thinking about the problem, you start from the end, with the trivial subcase, and keep adding the layers. But the recursive function kinda starts at the beginning, and that trivial case is the exit condition. R doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very efficient with these recursive functions, so this might become a C sub-routine eventually.</description>

      <description>pdg-control Problem statement: Maximize profits subject to $$\max_{h(t)} \int_0^T e^{-\rho t} \pi(x, h, t) dt $$ Subject to the state equations (biology):
$$ \dot x = x \exp \left( \alpha \left(1-\frac{x}{K}\right) \left( \frac{x-C}{K} \right) \right) - x h $$
Note that we consider the control variable to be effort, $h$ instead of harvest, $\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{H} = h x$.
and the constraints: $$ x(0) = X_0 \qquad x(T) = X_T $$ We have fixed boundary conditions (equalities) and equalities in the state equations, so we have a nice straight-forward problem.</description>

and boundary conditions: $\psi(y(t_F), u(t_F), t_F) = 0$. These are discrete, applying only at fixed time $t_F $. We have to put the continuous constraint in as an integral:
$$ \hat J = \left[\phi + \mathbf{\nu}^T \psi \right]_{tF} - \int{t_I}^{t_F} \mathbf{\lambda}^T \left(\dot{\mathbf{y}} - f(\mathbf{y}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)) \right) dt $$</description>

      <description>Consider a harvested fish population with discrete-time population dynamics under an allee effect:
$$ N_{t+1} = N_t \exp \left( \gamma \left[ 1-\frac{N_t}{K} \right] \left[ \frac{N_t - C}{K} \right] \right) - \beta E_h N_t$$
Note that C is the unfished allee threshold, K the carrying capacity, $E_h$ the fish harvesting effort.
Consider that the initial population is unknown, but described by a density function whose variance can be decreased by sampling. Just to get started, let&amp;rsquo;s assume log-normal (avoiding the chance of negative population sizes), with log-standard deviation inversely proportional to the sampling effort $E_s $.</description>

      <description>Very interesting article on tipping points that seems to answer a question I put to Vasilis back in 2009 at IIASA: whether critical transitions due to bifurcations could be distinguished from stochastic transitions due to rare events Ditlevsen &amp;amp; Johnsen, 2010. Argues that some of the well-known climate transitions may have been stochastic transitions instead. Will need a closer read to better assess how they are distinguishing between such transitions in the data.</description>

Meanwhile, some of the bloggers have done a rather nice day-to-day coverage; no idea how they all manage to keep up.

My own highlights certainly include Steve Pacala&amp;rsquo;s fantastic plenary session in receiving the MacArthur award, and Mark Urban&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear presentation on &amp;ldquo;climate collisions.&amp;rdquo; I thought I was less tolerant of data-free models with arbitrary assumptions these days, but somehow Mark just swept those concerns away. In pointing out really fundamental concepts, such details just aren&amp;rsquo;t so important.</description>

      <description>What you want to look for are stock assessments. For example, for the species closest to home, under the Pacific Fisheries Management Council:
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/archived-stock-assessments/
Three rockfish species that might be good to look into for your purposes are widow, yelloweye, and bocaccio, but these will have shorter-term data than any of the cod data. Also, NOAA NMFS Technical Reports on individual stocks often have long appendices with lots of data.</description>

      <description>Peter advice  Figure out your focus. Have all the stuff from your PhD published (at least submitted), make sure your post-doc moves forward. (#1 mistake). Publish with data folks to show you have much to offer the non-theorist community Speak to potential advisers, get them excited about the work. Berkeley over Michigan over NESCent/NIMBioS. Visit Berkeley. Ackerley on sabbatical?  Review for Theoretical Ecology Working on another review. Not a bad paper, but presenting many classical results as novel.</description>

      <description>Marissa mentioned looking into some of the fisheries data for early warning signals: particularly the Canadian Cod collapse.
Apparently several of the data sets are problematic. All deal with catch instead of abundance and measurement error is highly significant, though it seems that some may suffer from more troublesome systematic errors. Taking a quick look over what is available. Lots of data, but despite what appears to be some rather sophisticated tools available on the sites, I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of difficulty finding just what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the model choice/model adequacy section of the appendix. This is the section that Reviewer 2 said needed further development, which would be beyond the scope of this paper:
 Here the authors claim that by using particular structural models based on assumptions about underlying dynamics their method makes it easy to identify cases that do not conform to the assumptions. It would be interesting to evaluate this claim but it would require a substantial amount of analysis that may be beyond the scope of a short paper.</description>

      <description>Working on ESA presentation. See slides and code for details.
 Adding movie a time series which gets longer (and closer to collapse) each frame, with corresponding warning signals for the interval thus far shown below (for CV and autocorrelation). Include sparsely sampled (100) and densely sampled (1000) examples. Compare always using a sliding window-size equal to half the length of the available data (works well on longer time series) to a fixed-width sliding window (doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well ever).</description>

(Bedford &amp;amp; Hartl, 2009) OU vs BM (or just estimation of selection in the OU model relative to tree length) would have been an obvious way to do this, but the paper tries to make the argument that scaling the data and then comparing

      <description>The Gillespie algorithm has two parts: (1) determine what event happens, (2) determine when it happens. Consider the system of equations $$ \dot X_i = f_i(\vec X) $$
where the $f_i$ give the rates of creation and annihilation (negative and postive parts of $f_i(\vec X)$ must be listed seperately) for all species $x_i$. We assume this gives the mean rate at which each event occurs, drawn from on exponential distribution. We could simply draw the associated random exponential time for each reaction, and pick the minimum for which event occurs.</description>

Variance While the initial example with variance shows almost no signal, increasing the sampling effort substantially improves the performance. This can be seen in the ROC curves and as a tightening and spreading out of the null and test distributions as the sampling effort is increased.</description>

  Reading  Yet another volley in the kin-selection group-selection debate (debacle?)(Marshall, 2011)
 This looks excellent, will have to find time for a closer read: (Davies et. al. 2011)

      <description>In preparing manuscript on warning signals, reviewing the literature on when statistical validation of the warning signal is included, and if so, what kind are done. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly no consensus in the approach, with the majority of papers not even attempting a method (and those that do not finding significance). Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s key review (Scheffer et. al. 2009) calls for the need to measure statistical significance of warning signals,
 Therefore, it would be useful to build a set of reliable statistical procedures to test whether an increase in autocorrelation, for example, is significant.</description>

      <description>Warning signals package  Reviewing Numerical challenges for faster analysis on warningsignals
 created a quick mcmcTools package so different packages can use my custom routines. Will have to explore some of the standard packages eventually, though most seem somewhat specialized (the Bayesian task-view is epic). bayesm looks promising, and LearnBayes package that accompanies Jim Albert&amp;rsquo;s book (Albert, unknown) might be worth a closer look.
 Wrote mcmc script for warningsignals, much more debugging to handle out-of-bounds conditions then expected.</description>

  Seminar on Species trees Coop/Moore Seminar on *BEAST (Heled &amp;amp; Drummond, 2009) and BEST (Liu et. al. 2008).
Essential differences: BEST uses Mr. Bayes to compute probabilities over gene trees (over uniform prior). Then estimates the species tree by importance sampling from this distribution to reflect constraints under a convergence model. Integrates over effective population sizes rather than estimating (highly uncertain anyway), requires rooting, and a rather fast/loose implementation of ultra-metricizing trees.</description>

      <description>Alan and I have been considering analyzing a particular system for early warning signals where we could highlight risk management from an economics stand-point, probably with the help of Jim Sanchirico. Our current work focuses on quantifying the relative risk of false alarms and missed detections. While statisticians typically accept a 5% &amp;ldquo;false alarm&amp;rdquo; rate, we argue this given limited data this is always a trade-off against the missed detection rate and hence the location of this threshold should properly a decision of management, not of convention.</description>

      <description>Trying a different set-up for the graphs. Added two additional datasets, trying layout of making all three figures into a panels in a single figure.
Concerns:
 Better than only one empirical example, but not sure that the three Glaciation data sets add that much since they are all quite similar. Five panels wide might be too much. Don&amp;rsquo;t have an example where a transition is about to occur but the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t have adequate power even for our Likelihood method, third panel.</description>

      <description>Read over Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s rather nice introduction(Scheffer, 2010) to the Drake paper(Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010). Last paragraph is particularly pertinenant:
 Clearly, we have just scratched the surface in exploring the possibilities and limitations of this emerging field. However, the prospect of identifying generic indicators is exciting, as the approach may provide an independent way to assess the risk of critical transitions. Expansion of our toolbox for prediction is especially welcome given the almost insurmountable problem of modelling complex systems in a quantitatively accurate way.</description>

Ergodicity Null of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau/rank correlations &amp;ndash; independence of X and Y, not satisfied even over replicates. Adjusted codes to use Pearson&amp;rsquo;s (default option, need to pass option up to higher-level functions). Repeated Figure 2 plots with Pearson&amp;rsquo;s, results not much different, funny multimodal though:
Actually verifying independence is rather more challenging, though convenient in this case that a test such as Pearson&amp;rsquo;s is not designed to do this, see http://en.</description>

      <description>Today working mostly on selecting examples of data sets to include in the figure patterns. Working with the idea of three figures &amp;ndash; data, bootstraps of Tau, bootstraps of likelihood &amp;ndash; in panels for several examples: some real data sets and some simulated data sets with and without warning. In addition to this, I still have some more work to do with references, and refining the writing of a few of the appendices.</description>

      <description>Summary Paragraph
 Critical transitions exist (Holling, 1973), (May, 1977),(Scheffer et. al. 2001) Warning signals exist (Scheffer et. al. 2009), (Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010) Warning signals are summary statistics, critical slowing down (Wissel, 1984). Statement of general problem: double-edged sword &amp;ndash; no quantification of the chance detection scheme will fail. We provide a way to do this We find existing methods lack sufficient power and have high false-alarm potential We provide a model-based solution using machinery of modern likelihood statistics  Background  Define CSD, standard detection scheme.</description>

      <description>Working on more examples for the notebook. Currently exploring a collection of simulated examples. In particular, would be useful to have simulated examples that look as realistic in data-density as possible (i.e. fewer sample points, also shorter sampling interval relative to timescale, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a fuzzy caterpillar. Second, would be good to include examples on data simulated from non-linearized systems made to represent some richer bifurcation examples. Finally it would be good to include as many real-data examples as reasonable.</description>

      <description>Manuscript revisions  Heard back from Alan this morning on manuscript, need to cut wordcount in half, from 3000 to 1500 words. Should emphasize the countless and utterly arbitrary choices made in every one of these analyses. Should emphasize our approach can be applied without replicates. (also without interpolating/having evenly sampled data) Should do coefficient of variation on non-detrended data(?) should discuss?  Chemostat data This morning Alan sent me the data used by Drake &amp;amp; Griffen (Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010).</description>

      <description>Variance and warning signals Sebastian has several examples of dynamical systems that decrease in variance as they approach a bifurcation. In some sense this is not surprising, both are through the collapse of periodic attractors. Figure 2d in TPB paperSchreiber, 2003 has an example in a discrete system, and Figure 5a in the Ecology Letters paper (Schreiber &amp;amp; Rudolf, 2008) has a continuous-time example. Consider for instance the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, in which a stable limit cycle vanishes into an unstable node, as in a van der Pol oscillator,</description>

 Longer baseline run, nice 19, indicator_vs_likelihood.R 1600 reps, m=-0.015, N=500, T=100
 Longer sampling, same interval: nice 18, stronger_signal.R 160 reps m=-0.015, N = 2500, T=500
  Fails to compute, looks like poor estimates of model fits.

      <description>Added bar of observed tau on real data to the tau distributions. Fixed the tau-distribution method, running new data and real examples now.
Simulated data: can tell tau apart for instance, for autocorrelation (see photostream for variance, code hash for parameters, etc). While can&amp;rsquo;t really tell anything based on the tau on the autocorrelation for the Deuterium data for Glaciation III (which has just about the clearest signal of the deuterium set): Waiting to see how the likelihood statistics compare on these examples.</description>

      <description>Worried about accurate maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, as the optimization could still converge on values not far from the starting conditions (not as surprising as the starting parameters are estimated intelligently first from the summary statistics) but could also vary depending on initial conditions.
Second, while it requires some re-parameterization, the stationary model for both linearized transcritical (LTC) bifurcation model and the linearized saddle-node (LSN) model are identically Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models.</description>

      <description>Working on a little data exploration while writing up manuscript. I have been puzzled why it appears that most estimates of tau on the CaCO3 data infer negative correlation, as in
Despite the fact that there seems to be a loss of stability in the model:
require(warningsignals) load(&amp;quot;CaCO3.Rdat&amp;quot;) timedep$pars Ro m theta sigma 8.36841588 -0.03347119 -2.86194248 282.03234042  So m is negative, so that the system is loosing stability, but only very gradually.</description>

      <description>Continuing my exploration in applying these techniques to real climate data. Applying the Kendall&amp;rsquo;s Tau based approach on real data.
Greenhouse Earth, CaCO3 data:
Glaciation I-IV (deuterium data)
These use the unadjusted timeseries, and hence don&amp;rsquo;t reproduce the values of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau statistic reported in (Dakos et. al. 2008). In fact they don&amp;rsquo;t even agree on the sign &amp;ndash; visually many of the datasets are certainly decreasing in variance. I ran the Monte-Carlo distributions for tau on models estimated from these data-sets with and without warning, for variance (left) and autocorrelation (right), in the CaCO3 data:</description>

      <description>Continuing my tweaks to code to apply warning signals to the climate data used in (Dakos et. al. 2008). After adjusting my code to deal with variably spaced sampling intervals, I reread the supplement &amp;ndash; I had forgotten that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually consider data with variable time-scales, but instead interpolate the curves to have equally spaced sampling intervals.
Obviously this is not ideal. It is true that the autocorrelation would be impacted by non-equally spaced data, while there is no reason to do so for the variance indicator.</description>

Do we choose to present this as:
As Hypothesis Testing Null = isn&amp;rsquo;t a loss of stability (distribution produced by the MLE model of no stability loss), hypothesis = there is (distribution produced by, MLE model with stability loss) determine p value for falsely rejecting the null and the power of the statistical test.</description>

      <description>Morning has been rather difficult trying to get simulations up and running. Parallel library isn&amp;rsquo;t running on zero or one, variety of errors that seemed to be machine dependent and reminiscent of the ~./sfCluster problem, 3 hrs of debugging revealed this was indeed just a bug in my updated code. (In changing to my object-oriented simulate.gauss and update.gauss functions rather than calling the specific functions directly I hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated all the function calls).</description>

      <description>Going several directions at once in tweaking the warning signals code to make sure I have clear comparisons that are not resulting from any limitations in the numerical algorithms. Performing a variety of error checks, etc:
 Comparing fixed models vs comparing models estimated from the data
 Ensure that const model doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to estimate m (doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact likelihood anyway
 Ensure only positive values of sigma are returned (trying use trigger in setLTC and setLSN to return infinite variance if sigma is negative)</description>

Some difficulty in the &amp;ldquo;snowfall&amp;rdquo; parallel computation engine, removing the ~/.sfCluster directory seems to reset the error &amp;ldquo;unable to unserialize nodes&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo; Also don&amp;rsquo;t have good handling of variable names for tracking the boostrapping of parameters. For the moment have just added a toggle to suppress these to avoid dim mismatch in rownames command. Strange that this happens to the indicator_vs_likelihood code but not to the nearly-identical call to montecarlotest() in lin_bifur_models.</description>

      <description>Continuing writing and experimentation for examples in the warning signals manuscript, figuring out how to explain the need for the likelihood-based model comparison approach rather than the standard method of summary statistics.
The traditional approach computes a particular &amp;ldquo;leading indicator&amp;rdquo;, such as variance or autocorrelation, in a sliding window along the time series. If the system is loosing stability approaching a bifurcation, it&amp;rsquo;s leading eigenvalue must go through zero and hence shows critical slowing down, with the associated pattern of increasing autocorrelation an increasing variance.</description>

      <description>Simulations completed, help accentuate the different paths for branching. When the most failures occur while waiting for the first mutation to enter first established dimorphism, mutation rate seems limiting (left):
(right) With a higher mutation rate, most collapses back to monomorphism occur after a mutation successfully invades in the dimorphic population. Unfortunately these runs result in large fraction of the ensemble never reaching the final branching, those that do, do so fast:</description>

      <description>My last post was a bit pessimistic, sometimes I can still miss the forest for the trees. Hidden in those figures, the main point has been staring me in the face. So let&amp;rsquo;s try this again.
Stochastic limits to evolutionary branching is the story of two dueling timescales. The first timescale is that of the evolutionary process: the frequency of steps (mutation rate, $ \mu$) and the size of the steps (mutation kernel standard deviation $ \sigma_{\mu}$), on top of which we add the selection gradient, created by the ecology.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I derived the linearized SDEs for the saddle node bifurcation :
$$ dX = 2\sqrt{r(t)} (\sqrt{r(t)} + \theta -X) dt + \sigma \sqrt{\sqrt{r(t)}+\theta} dB_t $$
and the transcritical bifurcation
$$ dX = r(t) (K - X) dt + \sqrt{K} dB_t $$
Now to implement them for fitting by likelihood using generic $ r(t) $. I go back to the warning() model implemented in sde_likelihood.R code. We can just solve the odes directly:</description>

      <description>Have spent the last three days building and testing the infrastructure to fit the canonical form of a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation by likelihood. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t use the canonical form straight up: $ dx/dt = x^2 +r$ cannot be fit directly in this manner, since it needs a couple scale transformations on the variables to get the units right (a multiple for the unit scale and an additive factor for the zero point), and more importantly, isn&amp;rsquo;t a stochastic model so cannot assign probabilities to the outcomes.</description>

[flickr-gallery mode=&amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; tags=&amp;ldquo;quadraticfitslides&amp;rdquo; tag_mode=&amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo;]
Analysis of fits Of course these fits rely entirely on mapping the location of the stable point and the slope through that point, something they still cannot do all that well. In this parameterization the the stable intercept is $$ \hat x = \sqrt{r}+\theta $$ and slope at intercept is $$ \frac{\partial f(\hat x)}{\partial x} = -2\sqrt{r} $$ This creates a numerical optimization problem, since there is high importance on getting the mean right, and less on the variance, the routine tends to fix the combination of r and theta to get the mean right, and then cannot change r to get the slope correct without getting penalized for the loss of likelihood in changing the mean.</description>

$$dX = \left( r - (x-\theta)^2\right)dt + \beta \sqrt{X} dB_t $$
and the linear noise approximation gives a linear Fokker Planck equation such that the probability distribution is Gaussian with moments ((corrected from yesterday to scale noise, basically as pure-birth Poisson process))
$$\frac{d \hat{x}}{dt} &amp;amp;= r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 $$ $$ \frac{d \sigma^2}{dt} &amp;amp;= -2 (\hat x - \theta )\sigma^2 + \beta \left(r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 \right) $$</description>

A little work can show is equal to the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, $ \langle x(t) x(t&amp;rsquo;) \rangle = C(t-t&amp;rsquo;) $.

      <description>Consider the first-order autoregressive process: $$ X_{t+1} = \rho X_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}Z_t $$
Why the funny term at the end? This comes from normalizing the variance,

by independence:
$$ = \rho^2 E(X_t^2) + 2 \rho \sqrt{1-\rho^2} E( X_t ) E( Z_t ) + E( X_t^2) E(Z_t^2) (1-\rho^2) $$</description>

The warning signals question then becomes a model-choice problem between constant and time-dependent coefficients:
$$ dX_t = \alpha \left(\theta_t - X_t\right) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$
and
$$ dX_t = \alpha_t (\theta_t - X_t) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$</description>

      <description>Yesterday I began to address concerns of different models that have different mean dynamics, and how this influences the warning signals. This poses several kinds of issues.
 First, if the mean is changing, the model fitting must be appropriate to this &amp;ndash; either by fitting this rate of change or correcting for it.
 Second, the variance is expected to scale with the mean, and scale differently under different noise models (particularly environmental vs.</description>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden. The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump. The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>Adaptive dynamics is a set of recently developed techniques for understanding phenotypic evolution, using a dynamical systems approach to concepts from evolutionary game theory. In contrast to population genetics, this approach tends to explore richer ecological interactions and simpler genetic assumptions, with significant controversy. My own work has focused on a particular element of the theory known as the canonical equation, a macroscopic equation describing the deterministic rate of evolution.</description>

      <description>Ecological population sizes fluctuate not only in response to environmental fluctuations but because of the stochastic nature of natural births and deaths. While in very large populations these fluctuations have negligible impact, ecology rarely obliges us by satisfying this limit. Age and stage structure in populations serve to amplify the effect, where the fate of the population is determined by a smaller subset of, say, the fecund adults alone. Demographic noise is probably responsible for the ultimate extinction of many populations once reduced to a small size.</description>

We consider adding additional sources of noise through observation error and implementation error to the orginal model of Reed (1979), which considers only growth error. This follows in the line of exploration taken by Clark and Kirkwood (1987), Roughgarden (1996) and Sethi (2006).</description>

      <description>I am trying to understand the interface for tgp method, but much of it is not well documented (yes, despite reading through the package R manual, two nice vignettes, and a the PhD Thesis describing it.)
Just to get some consistent notation down: consider the case of a Gaussian process with a Gaussian/radial basis function kernel, parameterized as:
$$K(X, X&amp;rsquo;) = \sigma^2 e^{\frac{(X-X&amp;rsquo;)^2}{d}}$$
And observations from $Z = f(X) + \varepsilon$, for which we seek to approximate $f$ as a (multivariate) Gaussian process, $Z | X ~ N(\mu, C)$.</description>

      <description>Code gp_transition_matrix for generic multi-dimensional case  Understanding Gaussian Process performance If the estimated recruitment dynamics correspond to population dynamics that are non-persistent (might call this non self-sustaining, but in a rather stricter sense than when Reed (1979) introduced that term), and if no reward is offered at the terminal time point for a standing stock (zero scrap value), the GP dictates the rather counter-intuitive practice of simply removing the stock entirely.</description>

      <description>Notes on structure of examples Externalized code so that different example scripts call identical commands for fitting and plotting to avoid duplication of code. Example scripts tend to be pretty text poor at the moment, would probably benefit by better descriptions in the markdown. May still involve redundant and potentially out of date descriptions though.
Currently, externalized code for GP comparison experiments is in gaussian-process-control.R, and is called by may79-example.</description>

      <description>Writing  Working on nonparametric-bayes.  Reading Interesting PNAS comment from Doney &amp;amp; Sailley, (2013) (&amp;ldquo;When an ecological regime shift is really just stochastic noise&amp;rdquo;) on the Di Lorenzo &amp;amp; Ohman, (2013) piece in the same issue, showing that time integrated zooplankton data correlates closely with environmental drivers: in this case, the pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index, which would be missed by the traditional approach of direct correlations. This refutes the previous explanation of such shifts observed in the krill populations as being driven by nonlinear ecological interactions, rather than merely linearly tracking the environment ((Hare &amp;amp; Mantua, 2000)).</description>

      <description>This post creates new tag eml for posts discussing the Ecological Markup Langauge or the implementation of an R parser thereof (reml).
Why EML? Jones et al.(2005) give an excellent explanation describing the relative advantage of the descriptive metadata approach over vertically integrated repositories (such as Genbank, TreeBase, or many other repostories that have been the focus of rOpenSci development to date).
In short, the EML approach allows archiving of very heterogeneous data without having to standardize everything into a narrow and pre-defined syntax.</description>

      <description>Exploring XML Schema in R I danced around the room after reading these lines in the excellent XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R book:
 We can generate S4 class definitions corresponding to the data structures that are represented in the XML document. We can programmatically generate R code that will map an XML document adhering to this schema to corresponding R data structures. Similarly, we can automate the creation of code to serialize, or write, an R object of a particular type to a suitable XML format corresponding to the schema</description>

Initial goals To start, I am aiming for a proof of principle case in which we can write an R data.frame into EML (issue #2), publish to a remote repository such as figshare (issue #3), and then read the data back in as the original R object types from the EML (issue #6).</description>

Semantics Writing Semantics. Lots of elements of the EML schema have semantic meaning, but we can&amp;rsquo;t start leveraging ontological tools while these terms are defined only as part of the Schema vocabulary. In their current state, they are just &amp;ldquo;meaningless bits of syntax&amp;rdquo;, e.</description>

      <description>Reached a milestone in reml development today with basic implementation of reading, writing, and publishing valid EML files and a working test suite.
An S4-based structure This involved a complete re-write of the pre-ESA code and is now completely S4-class based, allowing a more flexible structure that is easier and faster to extend. For instance, rather than having to explicitly think about the commands to parse and serialize a new metadata element that needs to be added from the schema, we just define the class for the object.</description>

      <description>Meeting with M. Samoilov  Kurtz Theorems: two limits, timescale and system size, often taken in the wrong order in practice. Einstein-Smoluchowski debate regarding Langevin correspondence to Ito vs Statonvich representations resolved: [theorem]. (Statonvich is the more natural interpretation of the way in which we measure data to compare to Langevin. Of course Ito and Stratonvich can be mapped back and forth anyway). Of course this difference doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and nothing goes wrong / no stochastic surprises if dynamics are linear.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow will be meeting with my dissertation committee: Alan Hastings, Peter Wainwright, and Brian Moore. This provides a good opportunity to summarize the status of my current projects and my principle accomplishments for the year. Will try a tex&amp;rsquo;d document as I&amp;rsquo;ve done in previous years but here&amp;rsquo;s for some preliminary brainstorming.
 Summary: In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published one paper, given 4 talks (CPB, NIMBioS, Berkeley, IIASA), read 144+ articles and wrote 9000+ lines of code.</description>

      <description>Adjusted individual based Crowley model to follow same parameterization as the macroscopic model. IBM rules had divided b and c by K in the dynamics while the macroscopic was just using rescaled dynamical rates. Now both use the rescaled rates as parameter values while the equations match.
 Variation in the Crowley model agrees between individual-based simulation and the equations.

      <description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking the Jacobian of the transition terms. Fixes the unstable behavior and disagreement between simulations and theory. Other note: the &amp;ldquo;hastings.c&amp;rdquo; model can trivially be obtained from the standard crowley-form metapopulation model by taking b_1 = 0.  For the crowley class of models at least, seems that while the two-step vs one-step involved different dynamics, this difference exists only in transients while equilbrium covariances agree.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve come quite a way in my C coding from those early Gillespie simulations for adaptive dynamics two years ago). Still need to pull the API out of the single file. Doxygen-compatible literate programming included, but needs significant expansion before it can really be used effectively as an API for other users.</description>

Recall our dynamics are d(n) = *e*n + a
and defining the jump moments (van Kampen) α~1~(n) = b(n) − d(n)
α~2~(n) = b(n) + d(n)

recall that we have a linear Fokker-Planck equation whose solution is Gaussian and specified by the first two moments:  These are implemented in code using GSL ode library.</description>

Starting with a simple test case of a modified Crowley model:   Model is implemented on a branch of the warningSignals package. Model in crowley.c, Depends on modified gillespie.c library in this package. Branching necessary as implementation simplifies the gillespie function dependencies, but these changes would break compatibility with warning_signals.</description>

 Still, the approach should be able to do more than describe single points as unexpected deviates. Still need to address gradual change vs change point analysis.

So far theory is essentially built on a model selection between linear models.</description>

Exploring full ensemble simulations of beetle dynamics. Linear noise approximations (Fig 2) show divergent noise under oscillating conditions (Fig 2 lower panel), though this may be an artifact of the approximation, which applies only for finite time calculations.

Note that mean dynamics agree, and oscillations damp out, Fig 1 simulation means (circles) fall exactly on predicted lines. Variance dynamics do not agree.</description>

      <description>Pursuing a matrix form, seems I had missed some terms in the covariance equations Friday, which are suggested by the nice symmetry of this representation: (sometimes chalk and a camera are faster than tex).
This suggests the general form looks like
*dM* = *JM* + (*J*M)^T^ + g
Where M is the covariance matrix and J the Jacobian of f as before. dM is the matrix of derivative terms, though clearly not a rigorous notation.</description>

Required rewriting gillespie function so as to intelligently calculate rates rather than writing 3K+1 functions. This leads to an alternative gillespie simulation interface that takes a function to calculate rates, producing cumulative sum (though perhaps that step should be moved into the raw gillespie code) of rates for each event, and an outcome function that will execute the outcome of each of those events.</description>

Recent papers in early warning signals This invistigation is in a very similar spirit to two other recent papers on the subject. Kéfi et al. addresses a different kind of false positive for early warning signals, arising in systems approaching other transitions or bifurcations than the intended culprit, the saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <description>Fig 1: Noise in lavae dominate
Fig: 2 lower mortality, higher noise
 Success! My first full implementation of the four stage (EPLA) beetle model, so far without any adaptation, and the noise of the larval class dominates (Fig 1). Without the time delays the stationary dynamics are stable nodes, at least in this part of parameter space, with a large adult class clamping tightly down on the other classes.</description>

      <description>svn revision 27 should have functional parallel code! Certainly I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten much better at openmp in the past few days. Difficult to maintain a general API that is agnostic to the model details and still knows enough about the data formats to declare them appropriately for each thread. My lesson for my future coding: by writing with parallelization concepts in mind from the start I should be able to significantly reduce the overhead time when I go back and add openmp directives.</description>

After a good bit more exploring permutations of openmp commands and experimenting with code (should have been done in a branch version so would be in the version management, instead done in my local experimental sandbox so will have to implement and merge into real code still!) was able to understand the root of my problem and pose a coherent question.

      <description>Current population dynamics model macroscopic equations:
Interpreting μ terms as death events, b as birth, and the a terms as transitions between age classes gives a natural form for the master equation.
Divergent Solutions to the linear noise approximation? Breaking the age classes into k subclasses makes waiting time within an age class gamma instead of exponential, which better matches observation. Also allows sustained oscillations. The numerical solution to the linear noise approximation shows divergent variance dynamics.</description>

      <description>Single replicate. Almost all warning signals have significant correlation despite the constant environment.
False warning signals remain just as common when signals are averaged across 100 replicates?
 Exploring statistical qualification of early warning signals. Dakos et. al. (2008) use a correlation significance test (based on Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau) on the autocorrelation to detect the warning signals. Correlation significance test seems a very poor estimate of signal, high false positive rate at any threshold p-value for sufficiently frequent sampling.</description>

      <description>Noise in the larval class is damped by and grows proportional to its intrinsic variation and the contribution of other classes through their derivatives of f~L~, that is, as well as the sum of its intrinsic rates (essentially whichever is larger). Taking E dynamics to be fast we might reduce to a continous time LPA model:  and the larval fluctuations are essentially:

 Tried time averaging over the entire time window (set sample_size to 1 less than max time); in close agreement with the ensemble predictions (getting around 1355). Mystery doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually be a problem in the method, but just innate variability! Even over reasonable time-averages and ensemble averages there&amp;rsquo;s significant deviation from the expected variance! This variation around the warning signal/leading indicator is exactly what might frustrate the warning signal.</description>

      <description>Most papers do not give a statistical approach, but merely argue for the existence of a trend. Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau approach proved very unreliable. While the preliminary de-trending approach is unjustified in that the simulated data is known to be absent from trends, as a kind of windowed averaging it may sense as a way to detect changes. Should distinguish between the gradual slow changes and change-point estimation. Perhaps change-point provides a more rigorous starting point.</description>

      <description>Exploring convergence in maximum likelihood model fits each on data produced by their own simulation method:
 fit1, basic OU method, converges just fine. (using L-BFGS-B method with appropriate bounding box to avoid negatives). fit2 , the linear change rate model, converges fine using Nelder-Meade (using 1e12 ~ inf likelihood return when attempting negative alpha or sigma), but throws hard errors for L-BFGS-B:   Error in optim(pars, warning.likfn, method = method, lower = lower) : non-finite finite-difference value [3]   fit3 runs on &amp;ldquo;L-BFGS-B&amp;rdquo; and returns reasonable values, though not meeting convergence standards.</description>

      <description>bootstrapping models implemented improved handling of model classes &amp;ndash; included T, t0, N, and X0 in object def implemented plotting for model bootstrap difficulties with changePt model fit remain. fixed one source of trouble &amp;ndash; no longer passes zero-length data to OU.lik() when t_shift is outside the time interval.  Still giving errors on coercing lists into doubles for the saddle_node bifurcation simulated data set. &amp;ndash;fixed, was getting t_shift as a vector from time(X).</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping for likelihood ratios! Updated class behavior &amp;ndash; all simulation and fitting routines now return timeseries objects as data with correct range and timestep. updated plotting routines. Likelihood ratio plotting function. Bootstraps of parameters can be plotted using the output from the likelihood ratio fit simulation, avoiding redundancy, just specify which model is desired. Bootstrap likelihood ratio plots includes the original ratio and calculates plot range using this information.</description>

      <description>Deuterium early warning signal used for Glaciation I-IV presented in Dakos 2008:  Deuterium signal over past 4 glaciations
 Does smoothing to remove trends &amp;ndash; longer-scale fluctuations? Seems unnatural, many of those are part of the signal. Also applied to simulated time series &amp;ndash; even those these are at stationarity! Bandwidth chosen by visual inspection. Get the CaCO3 presented in Scheffer 2010 and Dakos 2008. &amp;ndash; Done: CaCO3</description>

      <description>Finished implementation of simulation from saddle-node example Implemented simulation from transition density for all three models  Whoops  The change point model can&amp;rsquo;t be summarized by the transition density, as this depends only on the time interval and not the absolute time. The nice description of being able to solve for the transition density when the transition occurs during the time interval specified is neither necessary nor applicable in this context!</description>

      <description>Summary  Have a functional likelihood calculation from the full individual-based simulation, see Friday. Accuracy needs more testing, and the computation is probably too slow for optimization routines. Have an implementation of the linear decrease in stability model with analytic conditional probability density. Needed a couple adjustments today. Need to add direct simulation to the warning signals package, currently retunrs only time-averaged/ensemble averaged stats. Can be approximated by setting the window equal to the timestep and ensembles equal to one.</description>

      <description>Structured populations part of project migrated to github from the google code page. Finally switched to using STL for linked list in simulation. Have working simulation function ensemble run function also calculates the probability based on kernel-density estimation from the replicates. Working on likelihood calculation.  Code progress  Lots of fun trying to get full structured population simulator working accurately. See git log for details, but ended up abandoning two separate versions of custom-written C linked lists and just switched entire code over to C++ to use the STL&amp;rsquo;s linked list, which finally worked like a charm.</description>

      <description>warning-signals  Working on revisions for ews-review Grr, the challenges of open science &amp;ndash; can&amp;rsquo;t stick confidential reviews in ews-review repo where they belong, or track them on the issues tracker, without disclosing their contents. What are the terms of use for these things anyhow&amp;gt;
  phylogentics / pmc  Apparently pmc does have users &amp;ndash; at least one recognized that my Vignette is broken following the latest Gieger update.</description>

      <description>Marc meeting: nonparametric-bayes manuscript Very good meeting today going over some big picture considerations in the presentation of the nonparametric-bayes manuscript with Marc. (Also see new entries in issues log on nonparametric-bayes.) Make it clear that we are making a point rather than providing a tool. Focus on the tipping point context rather than the general management context.
 Comparison against a parametric Bayesian model (40) Comparison against an active learning parametric model facing a tipping point (41)  Parametric Bayesian model Drafting parametric Bayesian case for comparison, following Marc&amp;rsquo;s suggestion.</description>
