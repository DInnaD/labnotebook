      <description>My last post was a bit pessimistic, sometimes I can still miss the forest for the trees. Hidden in those figures, the main point has been staring me in the face. So let&amp;rsquo;s try this again.
Stochastic limits to evolutionary branching is the story of two dueling timescales. The first timescale is that of the evolutionary process: the frequency of steps (mutation rate, $ \mu$) and the size of the steps (mutation kernel standard deviation $ \sigma_{\mu}$), on top of which we add the selection gradient, created by the ecology.</description>

      <description>Ran a series of simulations overnight to explore aspects of time-to-branching at different phases of the branching process. Still using only 16 replicates per data point, though increased maximum time for a run another order of magnitude to avoid timing out runs influencing the dataset for the slow-rate parameters. Still seems to suggest a regime beyond which branching becomes completely improbable. Not clear that the transition is a sharp as the Arrhenius approximation might suggest.</description>

      <description>Setting up some adaptive dynamics simulations to complete the parameter-space search. Currently the demo library contains two files, providing the coexistence-only tests and the full evolutionary simulation. This picks up from Aug 30/Sept 1 on coexistence times and Aug 12&amp;frasl;13 entries on waiting times until branching (while still on OWW).
coexistence times coexist_times.R creates contour plots of the coexistence time under demographic noise expected at a particular position of the pairwise invasibility plot (PIP).</description>

      <description>This time of year I have to file my renewal for my DOE Fellowship, including a statement of accomplishments and a summary of the computational aspects of my work. Seemed like a good idea to jot these down in my notebook as well:
synopsis of accomplishments over the year: In January I passed my qualifying exam, advancing to candidacy where my dissertation remains my only requirement. In March I attended the phylogenetics workshop in Bodega Bay, an internationally known week-long training program.</description>

      <description>Started trying to get the power curves for sample-size and rate of change. Currently focusing on the transcritical bifurcation model. This first pass uses just 100 replicates, which appears to be not nearly enough. Need some troubleshooting on handling to get power curves out. Scroll through, the set has 65 different images:

      <description>Updated methods for the Monte Carlo estimate of the distributions of likelihood ratios completed on Wednesday this week, modulo some troubleshooting of code. Now exploring the parameter range in which warning signals can be identified with accurate power. Individual power tests provide a good start, but remains to generate power curves for each bifurcation type by magnitude of the loss of stability, length/duration of the timeseries and the sampling frequency.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I derived the linearized SDEs for the saddle node bifurcation :
$$ dX = 2\sqrt{r(t)} (\sqrt{r(t)} + \theta -X) dt + \sigma \sqrt{\sqrt{r(t)}+\theta} dB_t $$
and the transcritical bifurcation
$$ dX = r(t) (K - X) dt + \sqrt{K} dB_t $$
Now to implement them for fitting by likelihood using generic $ r(t) $. I go back to the warning() model implemented in sde_likelihood.R code. We can just solve the odes directly:</description>

      <description>Have spent the last three days building and testing the infrastructure to fit the canonical form of a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation by likelihood. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t use the canonical form straight up: $ dx/dt = x^2 +r$ cannot be fit directly in this manner, since it needs a couple scale transformations on the variables to get the units right (a multiple for the unit scale and an additive factor for the zero point), and more importantly, isn&amp;rsquo;t a stochastic model so cannot assign probabilities to the outcomes.</description>

      <description>Considering the fits of the quadratic models from yesterday.
[flickr-gallery mode=&amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; tags=&amp;ldquo;quadraticfitslides&amp;rdquo; tag_mode=&amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo;]
Analysis of fits Of course these fits rely entirely on mapping the location of the stable point and the slope through that point, something they still cannot do all that well. In this parameterization the the stable intercept is $$ \hat x = \sqrt{r}+\theta $$ and slope at intercept is $$ \frac{\partial f(\hat x)}{\partial x} = -2\sqrt{r} $$ This creates a numerical optimization problem, since there is high importance on getting the mean right, and less on the variance, the routine tends to fix the combination of r and theta to get the mean right, and then cannot change r to get the slope correct without getting penalized for the loss of likelihood in changing the mean.</description>

      <description>Working from the quadratic model for the saddle node bifurcation rather than the linear (OU) model. Recall that the dynamics are:
$$dX = \left( r - (x-\theta)^2\right)dt + \beta \sqrt{X} dB_t $$
and the linear noise approximation gives a linear Fokker Planck equation such that the probability distribution is Gaussian with moments ((corrected from yesterday to scale noise, basically as pure-birth Poisson process))
$$\frac{d \hat{x}}{dt} &amp;amp;= r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 $$ $$ \frac{d \sigma^2}{dt} &amp;amp;= -2 (\hat x - \theta )\sigma^2 + \beta \left(r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 \right) $$</description>

      <description>Meeting with Alan this morning. I haven&amp;rsquo;t solved likelihood of power spectra (previous couple entries in Stoch. Pop / warning signals), though after meeting with Sebastian (11&amp;frasl;9) probably the best method works from the correlation function. Define a new stochastic process Y $$ Y_1 = X_1 X_2 + X_2 X_3 + X_3 X_4 + \ldots $$ $$ Y_2 = X_1 X_3 + X_2 X_4 + \ldots $$ $$ Y_3 = \ldots $$</description>

      <description>Recall that we consider the power spectrum of some measurable fluctuating quantity x(t), defined as
$$ y(\omega) = \int0^T dt e^{i\omega t} x(t) $$ $$ S(\omega) = \lim{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2\pi T} \left| y(\omega)\right|^2 $$
A little work can show is equal to the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, $ \langle x(t) x(t&amp;rsquo;) \rangle = C(t-t&amp;rsquo;) $.
We evaluate the correlation function of their Fourier transform (note $ x (\omega) $ is really $ \tilde x(\omega)$, the new transformed variable, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the tilde only out of laziness):</description>

      <description>Matching the warning signal to different SDE models couldn&amp;rsquo;t retain the simplicity and generality needed, so I intend to work on the transformed data instead. Taking the power spectrum of the data, we have a new curve fitting problem:
(Code). This can be turned into a linear curve fitting problem by taking the log of the inverse Fourrier transform, then the slope is our stability parameter. Can we do this estimation by likelihood instead of least-squares?</description>

      <description>Consider the first-order autoregressive process: $$ X_{t+1} = \rho X_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}Z_t $$
Why the funny term at the end? This comes from normalizing the variance,
$$ \begin{multline} E( (\rho X_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} Z_t)^2 ) = E (\rho^2 X_t^2) + E(2 \rho X_t \sqrt{1-\rho^2}) Z_t ) + E( X_t^2 Z_t^2 (1-\rho^2) ) \end{multline}$$
by independence:
$$ = \rho^2 E(X_t^2) + 2 \rho \sqrt{1-\rho^2} E( X_t ) E( Z_t ) + E( X_t^2) E(Z_t^2) (1-\rho^2) $$</description>

      <description>The last few days have involved an investigation into the ability to capture the essential features of the dynamics leading up to a saddle node bifurcation as a linear stochastic differential equation. The warning signals question then becomes a model-choice problem between constant and time-dependent coefficients:
$$ dX_t = \alpha \left(\theta_t - X_t\right) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$
and
$$ dX_t = \alpha_t (\theta_t - X_t) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$</description>

      <description>Yesterday I began to address concerns of different models that have different mean dynamics, and how this influences the warning signals. This poses several kinds of issues.
 First, if the mean is changing, the model fitting must be appropriate to this &amp;ndash; either by fitting this rate of change or correcting for it.
 Second, the variance is expected to scale with the mean, and scale differently under different noise models (particularly environmental vs.</description>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden. The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump. The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>Noam gave an interesting presentation in our lab today, prompted me to do a little experimentation. Weakening stability across a set of coupled patches should result in increased autocorrelation. Decided to test this with a little visualization with help of a quick R script. Time progresses across the x-axis, 1-D space (on S1) across the y-axis. Each patch suffers a slow loss of stability, resulting in a clearly visible increase in autocorrelation.</description>

      <description>Adaptive dynamics is a set of recently developed techniques for understanding phenotypic evolution, using a dynamical systems approach to concepts from evolutionary game theory. In contrast to population genetics, this approach tends to explore richer ecological interactions and simpler genetic assumptions, with significant controversy. My own work has focused on a particular element of the theory known as the canonical equation, a macroscopic equation describing the deterministic rate of evolution.</description>

      <description>Ecological population sizes fluctuate not only in response to environmental fluctuations but because of the stochastic nature of natural births and deaths. While in very large populations these fluctuations have negligible impact, ecology rarely obliges us by satisfying this limit. Age and stage structure in populations serve to amplify the effect, where the fate of the population is determined by a smaller subset of, say, the fecund adults alone. Demographic noise is probably responsible for the ultimate extinction of many populations once reduced to a small size.</description>

      <description>Meeting with M. Samoilov  Kurtz Theorems: two limits, timescale and system size, often taken in the wrong order in practice. Einstein-Smoluchowski debate regarding Langevin correspondence to Ito vs Statonvich representations resolved: [theorem]. (Statonvich is the more natural interpretation of the way in which we measure data to compare to Langevin. Of course Ito and Stratonvich can be mapped back and forth anyway). Of course this difference doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and nothing goes wrong / no stochastic surprises if dynamics are linear.</description>

      <description>Updates  Likelihood calculation for beetle model. Proposed model and calculations Linear parameter change for warning signal model. Results in a few test cases. Likelihood methods within SDE framework, an outline of methods. Subtle problems, good approximations, powerful approaches.  
Questions  LPA vs ELLPA model Defining state space in individual-based model vs stage based model, setting initial conditions? Conclusion: Means non-Markovian system, so likelihood isn&amp;rsquo;t determined in one step approach.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow will be meeting with my dissertation committee: Alan Hastings, Peter Wainwright, and Brian Moore. This provides a good opportunity to summarize the status of my current projects and my principle accomplishments for the year. Will try a tex&amp;rsquo;d document as I&amp;rsquo;ve done in previous years but here&amp;rsquo;s for some preliminary brainstorming.
 Summary: In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published one paper, given 4 talks (CPB, NIMBioS, Berkeley, IIASA), read 144+ articles and wrote 9000+ lines of code.</description>

      <description>Adjusted individual based Crowley model to follow same parameterization as the macroscopic model. IBM rules had divided b and c by K in the dynamics while the macroscopic was just using rescaled dynamical rates. Now both use the rescaled rates as parameter values while the equations match.
 Variation in the Crowley model agrees between individual-based simulation and the equations.

      <description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking the Jacobian of the transition terms. Fixes the unstable behavior and disagreement between simulations and theory. Other note: the &amp;ldquo;hastings.c&amp;rdquo; model can trivially be obtained from the standard crowley-form metapopulation model by taking b_1 = 0.  For the crowley class of models at least, seems that while the two-step vs one-step involved different dynamics, this difference exists only in transients while equilbrium covariances agree.</description>

      <description>Just committed changes to the google project. warning_signals.c now provides a fully functional, ensemble enabled simulation written with functional API for general Gillespie simulations (at last! I&amp;rsquo;ve come quite a way in my C coding from those early Gillespie simulations for adaptive dynamics two years ago). Still need to pull the API out of the single file. Doxygen-compatible literate programming included, but needs significant expansion before it can really be used effectively as an API for other users.</description>

      <description>Goal for today: implement analytic calculations for warning signals.
 10am-12pm  Abstraction/functionalizing code.
 4pm-7pm  Implement GSL ode solvers for linear noise approximation:
Recall our dynamics are d(n) = *e*n + a
and defining the jump moments (van Kampen) α~1~(n) = b(n) − d(n)
α~2~(n) = b(n) + d(n)

recall that we have a linear Fokker-Planck equation whose solution is Gaussian and specified by the first two moments:  These are implemented in code using GSL ode library.</description>

      <description>Crowley Model  Exploring the extent to which demographic stochasticity in a key class can reverberate through the entire population dynamics. Starting with a simple test case of a modified Crowley model:   Model is implemented on a branch of the warningSignals package. Model in crowley.c, Depends on modified gillespie.c library in this package. Branching necessary as implementation simplifies the gillespie function dependencies, but these changes would break compatibility with warning_signals.</description>

      <description>Predicting variance of variance by direct calculation &amp;ndash; still need to crunch some math for the expected convergence.
 Still, the approach should be able to do more than describe single points as unexpected deviates. Still need to address gradual change vs change point analysis. Essentially the same as the phyolgenentic problem &amp;ndash; one rate vs two rates. Model selection approaches? So far theory is essentially built on a model selection between linear models.</description>

Exploring full ensemble simulations of beetle dynamics. Linear noise approximations (Fig 2) show divergent noise under oscillating conditions (Fig 2 lower panel), though this may be an artifact of the approximation, which applies only for finite time calculations.

Note that mean dynamics agree, and oscillations damp out, Fig 1 simulation means (circles) fall exactly on predicted lines. Variance dynamics do not agree.</description>

      <description>Pursuing a matrix form, seems I had missed some terms in the covariance equations Friday, which are suggested by the nice symmetry of this representation: (sometimes chalk and a camera are faster than tex).
This suggests the general form looks like
*dM* = *JM* + (*J*M)^T^ + g
Where M is the covariance matrix and J the Jacobian of f as before. dM is the matrix of derivative terms, though clearly not a rigorous notation.</description>

Required rewriting gillespie function so as to intelligently calculate rates rather than writing 3K+1 functions. This leads to an alternative gillespie simulation interface that takes a function to calculate rates, producing cumulative sum (though perhaps that step should be moved into the raw gillespie code) of rates for each event, and an outcome function that will execute the outcome of each of those events.</description>

 Success! My first full implementation of the four stage (EPLA) beetle model, so far without any adaptation, and the noise of the larval class dominates (Fig 1). Without the time delays the stationary dynamics are stable nodes, at least in this part of parameter space, with a large adult class clamping tightly down on the other classes.</description>

      <description>svn revision 27 should have functional parallel code! Certainly I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten much better at openmp in the past few days. Difficult to maintain a general API that is agnostic to the model details and still knows enough about the data formats to declare them appropriately for each thread. My lesson for my future coding: by writing with parallelization concepts in mind from the start I should be able to significantly reduce the overhead time when I go back and add openmp directives.</description>

      <description>A solution!  After a good bit more exploring permutations of openmp commands and experimenting with code (should have been done in a branch version so would be in the version management, instead done in my local experimental sandbox so will have to implement and merge into real code still!) was able to understand the root of my problem and pose a coherent question. Posting that question on stack overflow solved my problem in under an hour.</description>

      <description>Current population dynamics model macroscopic equations:
Interpreting μ terms as death events, b as birth, and the a terms as transitions between age classes gives a natural form for the master equation.
Divergent Solutions to the linear noise approximation? Breaking the age classes into k subclasses makes waiting time within an age class gamma instead of exponential, which better matches observation. Also allows sustained oscillations. The numerical solution to the linear noise approximation shows divergent variance dynamics.</description>

False warning signals remain just as common when signals are averaged across 100 replicates?
 Exploring statistical qualification of early warning signals. Dakos et. al.

Correlation significance test seems a very poor estimate of signal, high false positive rate at any threshold p-value for sufficiently frequent sampling.</description>

 Tried time averaging over the entire time window (set sample_size to 1 less than max time); in close agreement with the ensemble predictions (getting around 1355). Mystery doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually be a problem in the method, but just innate variability! Even over reasonable time-averages and ensemble averages there&amp;rsquo;s significant deviation from the expected variance! This variation around the warning signal/leading indicator is exactly what might frustrate the warning signal.</description>

      <description>Most papers do not give a statistical approach, but merely argue for the existence of a trend. Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau approach proved very unreliable. While the preliminary de-trending approach is unjustified in that the simulated data is known to be absent from trends, as a kind of windowed averaging it may sense as a way to detect changes. Should distinguish between the gradual slow changes and change-point estimation. Perhaps change-point provides a more rigorous starting point.</description>

      <description>Summary  Have a functional likelihood calculation from the full individual-based simulation, see Friday. Accuracy needs more testing, and the computation is probably too slow for optimization routines. Have an implementation of the linear decrease in stability model with analytic conditional probability density. Needed a couple adjustments today. Need to add direct simulation to the warning signals package, currently retunrs only time-averaged/ensemble averaged stats. Can be approximated by setting the window equal to the timestep and ensembles equal to one.</description>

      <description>Structured populations part of project migrated to github from the google code page. Finally switched to using STL for linked list in simulation. Have working simulation function ensemble run function also calculates the probability based on kernel-density estimation from the replicates. Working on likelihood calculation.  Code progress  Lots of fun trying to get full structured population simulator working accurately. See git log for details, but ended up abandoning two separate versions of custom-written C linked lists and just switched entire code over to C++ to use the STL&amp;rsquo;s linked list, which finally worked like a charm.</description>
