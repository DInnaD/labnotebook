More interested in exploring the data and methods than in just replicating the results, which are important but also rather intuitive and thus I expect rather robust – as we add (observational) uncertainty, or indeed, any additional parameters that must be ended, we should expect to have less power to pin down a particular parameter associated with density dependence, as the paper illustrates rather nicely.</description>

      <description>A first go at implementing the Dai et al model From the supplement to 10.1126/science.1219805, we have:
\[n_{t+1} = n_t g(n_t + \epsilon n_t, \theta)\] \[g(n_t) = \frac{n_{t+1}}{n_t}\]
 This model is based on two phases of daily growth: a slow exponential growth phase at low cell densities, followed by a logistic growth phase with a higher per capita growth rate at intermediate cell densities. This model has 5 parameters: T lag is the lag time before yeast cells start to grow after being transferred into new media (the total time for daily growth is 23 hours).</description>

      <description>Read this delightful John Harte Interview (ht @DynamicEcology) which resonates rather well with me (no surprise given our common background). Nevertheless, I would have to push back on a few pieces.
 From general laws flow absolutely bullet-proof insights and this is what we most need
 I must disagree. Bullet-proof insights are mathematical theorems. Their generality is an empirical question about their assumptions (not their predictions). (And lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much in support of the &amp;ldquo;what we most need&amp;rdquo; part, but it deserves to be substantiated.</description>

      <description>Random idea for possible further exploration:
The use of &amp;lsquo;big data&amp;rsquo; by UPS to perform lots of small efficiency gains seems to be everybody&amp;rsquo;s favorite example (NPR, The Economist). During a typical applications of optimal control for ecological conservation talk yesterday I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help thinking back to that story. The paradigm shift is not so much the kind or amount of the data being used as it is the control levers themselves.</description>

      <description>EML I&amp;rsquo;ve added a interface for custom units. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to mess around with additionalMetadata as it should be handled automatically. Just define the unit itself, like this 1:
create_custom_unit(id = &amp;quot;metersSquaredPerHectare&amp;quot;, parentSI = &amp;quot;dimensionless&amp;quot;, unitType = &amp;quot;dimensionless&amp;quot;, multiplierToSI = &amp;quot;0.0001&amp;quot;, description = &amp;quot;Square meters per hectare&amp;quot;)  and then use the id you give as the unit type in your unit.defs. create_custom_unit updates a custom_units list in the EMLConfig environment, which the eml or write_eml functions detect and use to write in the additional metadata.</description>

  currentdir = cd cd /home/cboettig/.matlab/MDPSOLVE addpath(genpath(cd)) cd /home/cboettig/.matlab/plot2svg addpath(genpath(cd)) cd(currentdir)  (I still find matlab/octave&amp;rsquo;s syntax of not distinguishing character strings from variable names from function names kind of terrifying, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the price of working with economists.</description>

      <description>A lot of the past week has been focused on some catching up and tidying up in my active projects in metadata manipulation and publishing tools, EML, RNeXML, and rfigshare. The full story of the week and half unfolds on github, but summarizing progress here.
rfigshare Changes to httr interface orginally broke rfigshare, though working with @hadley the original mechanism was restored through sign_oauth1.0(). The changes provided a much nicer mechanism for handling oauth authentication without having to specify tokens directly, and resulted in a relatively straightforward overhaul of the authentication mechanism in the package, while still preserving the package API.</description>

      <description>Reading  NAP report on &amp;ldquo;Abrupt impacts of climate change: anticipating suprises.&amp;rdquo;
 Nice overview of major climate tipping points. Interesting that the 2011 IPCC report put to rest concerns about a sudden transition of the thermohaline circulation within this century, despite good evidence that it is a bistable dynamic. Likewise appears to dismiss concerns of a tipping point related to the release of permafrost methane, thus putting aside the two most well-known and well-studied examples.</description>

      <description>Consider the model
$$d X_t = \alpha \left(\theta - X_t\right)dt + \sigma dB_t $$
By Ito Isometry, we have:
$$\langle X \rangle_t = E_t(X) = \theta \left(1 - e^{-\alpha t} \right) + X_0 e^{-\alpha t}$$
and
$$\langle X^2 \rangle_t - \langle X \rangle_t^2 = V_t(X) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \alpha }\left(1 - e^{-2 \alpha t} \right)$$
If we assume discrete, uniform sampling of spacing $\tau$, then we have,
$$P(\theta | X; \alpha, \sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi V_{\tau} }}^{T-1} \exp\left(-\frac{\sumt^{T-1} \left(X{t+1} - E\right)^2 }{2V}\right) $$</description>

      <description>MBI Workshop Paul Armsworth Very nice example of control in creating a market for ecosystem services for landowners. Key feature is that multiple land-owners respond by adjusting their prices, and so payments can be divided into fraction going into subsidy and fraction going into conservation. When one land-owner controls land that is particularly good cost per conservation accomplished, they also stand to gain largest value.
Also looked at auction mechanism and impact of cooperation among landowners to create hold outs.</description>

      <description>Authenticating via DataOne API Matt Jones provides a nice dataone package to handle accessing and posting data to DataOne nodes such as the KNB from R. Uploading files through the API requires authentication, which in turn requires a certificate from CILogin. As this process proved a bit tricky to me, I add some documentation here. I am using a Ubuntu (13.04) system, so the procedure might differ slightly for other systems.</description>

      <description>Fisheries data from Glaser et al. (2013) available at IchthyoDB Larvae and egg counts. About 4 GB, initialized in calcofi repo (local only).
Reading early warning with &amp;ldquo;Quickest Detection&amp;rdquo; algorithm described in Carpenter et al. (2013) and used by Batt et al. (2013), which includes a rather friendly explanation in the appendix (SI).
Uses a likelihood based method along with rather simple models of the probability of being in each state, and interestingly relies on the presence of a control system that has already experienced the transition.</description>

      <description>Scratching out some thoughts here to address an issue that continues to bug me with the way the literature discusses these two very different issues.
The ecological literature on early warning signals and related subjects continually seems to confuse the concept of state and regime.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get this straight.
Regime $=$ Attractor
 State $\neq$ Attractor
 Nonlinear state change $\neq$ Regime shift 
Evidence that a regime shift occurred, and when the shift occurred (e.</description>

      <description>Ever since writing the rfishbase package I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated by the lack of a proper API from Fishbase.org that would allow access to that wealth of information that is not exposed in the &amp;ldquo;Summary XML&amp;rdquo; files from which rfishbase extracts its content. Since writing the paper in Journal of Fish Biology, I continue to receive user requests asking if or how such-and-such a data element might be extracted. Usually this involves a disappointing boiler-plate reply about how the package is limited to the &amp;ldquo;Summary XML&amp;rdquo; data and that improved query potential must wait for a proper API from Fishbase.</description>

An S4-based structure This involved a complete re-write of the pre-ESA code and is now completely S4-class based, allowing a more flexible structure that is easier and faster to extend. For instance, rather than having to explicitly think about the commands to parse and serialize a new metadata element that needs to be added from the schema, we just define the class for the object.</description>

      <description>Exploring XML Schema in R I danced around the room after reading these lines in the excellent XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R book:
 We can generate S4 class definitions corresponding to the data structures that are represented in the XML document. We can programmatically generate R code that will map an XML document adhering to this schema to corresponding R data structures. Similarly, we can automate the creation of code to serialize, or write, an R object of a particular type to a suitable XML format corresponding to the schema</description>

      <description>This post creates new tag eml for posts discussing the Ecological Markup Langauge or the implementation of an R parser thereof (reml).
Why EML? Jones et al.(2005) give an excellent explanation describing the relative advantage of the descriptive metadata approach over vertically integrated repositories (such as Genbank, TreeBase, or many other repostories that have been the focus of rOpenSci development to date).
In short, the EML approach allows archiving of very heterogeneous data without having to standardize everything into a narrow and pre-defined syntax.</description>

      <description>If you do know the model and are simply uncertain about the parameters, you can often do all right (e.g. better than maximum likelihood approach) by doing the SDP over the Bayesian posterior distribution of the estimated model. Not surprisingly, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the correct model, this can fail pretty dramatically (in particular in very nonlinear models, e.g. tipping point models I have been looking at). Model choice and model averaging approaches aren&amp;rsquo;t much help here, because often the structurally correct model doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the observed data any better &amp;ndash; since the problems occur due to model inaccuracies where we don&amp;rsquo;t have data; e.</description>

      <description>Trying to find a better way to summarize outputs of simulations,
Heavy over-plotting makes the simulation trajectories themselves hard to read, even with transparent curves. Instead, we can plot the cumulative profit (technically should be discounted first):
We can normalize these profits as a fraction of the theoretical optimum (true), providing a comparison that is less dependent on model parameters.
We can then attempt to plot these on a single plot, either as stacked histograms:</description>

      <description>The difficulty in comparing the nonparametric Bayesian inference against parametric Bayesian inference is ensuring that the poorer performance of the latter is not do to numerical limitations of the MCMC (no one is quite so worried about the cases where the mcmc solution appears to work well&amp;hellip;) Convergence is almost impossible to truly establish, and lots of pathologies (correlations between variables, particularly without simulataneous updating) can frustrate it considerably. While multiple chains and long run times are the reasonable default, for simple enough models we can take a more direct approach.</description>

      <description>Consider the model
$$ X_{t+1} = X_t r e^{-\beta X_t + \sigma Z_t } $$
with $Z_t$ a unit normal random variable. The likelihood of the sequence of $T$ observations of $X$ under this model is thus
$$P(X | r, \beta, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}^{T-1}} \exp\left(\frac{\sumt^{T-1} \left(\log X{t+1} - \log X_t - \log r + \beta X_t\right)^2 }{2 \sigma^2}\right) $$
To integrate out $r$, $P(X | \beta, \sigma) = \int P(X | r, \beta, \sigma ) P&amp;reg; dr$, we&amp;rsquo;ll make this look like a Gaussian in $\log r$ by completing the square; getting the square on the outside of the sum.</description>

      <description>prosecutor  Bit more writing on comment reply. Sent to Alex and Alan for feedback.  nonparametric-bayes Demonstrating robustness of the GP approach is remarkably difficult ironically because the comparison methods are not particularly robust; most often due to poor initial conditions. Doing all I can to make the MLE and parametric Bayesian cases suitably automated such that the can give reasonable performance as I loop over various simulation parameters and models without much hand-holding of each of the estimators.</description>

      <description>As discussed with Marc in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s meeting, it would be useful to compare the Gaussian process, as a nonparametric Bayesian estimate, to the optimal management solution under a parametric Bayesian case, e.g. with the correct underlying model. This is implemented in BUGS (jags) through the R interface as described in Bolker B, Gardner B, Maunder M, Berg C, Brooks M, Comita L, Crone E, Cubaynes S, Davies T, de Valpine P, Ford J, Gimenez O, Kery M, Kim E, Lennert-Cody C, Magnusson A, Martell S, Nash J, Nielsen A, Regetz J, Skaug H and Zipkin E (2013).</description>

      <description>In this tutorial we walk through how to use the likelihood-based approach of Boettiger &amp;amp; Hastings (2012) to provide an early warning signal for a critical transition, and how to generate ROC curves discussed in the same paper for comparing different early warning signals. Context and details about the methodology are presented in the paper; here we focus on using the methodology provided in the accompanying R package. All of the examples shown here can be reproduced by pasting the code provided into an R terminal.</description>

      <description>Marc meeting: nonparametric-bayes manuscript Very good meeting today going over some big picture considerations in the presentation of the nonparametric-bayes manuscript with Marc. (Also see new entries in issues log on nonparametric-bayes.) Make it clear that we are making a point rather than providing a tool. Focus on the tipping point context rather than the general management context.

      <description>I have often observed (e.g. Boettiger &amp;amp; Hastings (2012) ) that if purely stochastic transitions out of a potential well happen, then they happen fast (dispite the fact that waiting time for them to happen is very long). Yesterday Marc mentioned an interesting proof of this from Don Ludwig, who was able to show that the waiting time to reach a large deviation in a time $t$, given that it reaches it at all, is of the same order as the return time from the large deviation to the equilibrium, $\log(L/\sigma)$.</description>

      <description>multiple-uncertainty  Fixed issues with translation to matlab and applyfun. Element-wise calls can use meshgrid arguments directly, and one can force functions to use element-wise operations with bxfun. So the following are equivalent: :  [X, Y] = meshgrid(x,y) applyfun(@min, X, Y)  or
function out = element_min(x,y) bxfun(@min, x, y) element_min(X, Y)  Meanwhile my challenge with additional arguments to applyfun can be circumvented with an inline function,</description>

      <description>(Corresponds to commit 4bd8422107 in earlywarning repo)
For the individual-based simulation, the population dynamics are given by
$$\begin{align} \frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} &amp;amp;= b{n-1} P(n-1,t) + d{n+1}P(n+1,t) - (b_n+d_n) P(n,t), b_n &amp;amp;= \frac{e K n^2}{n^2 + h^2}, d_n &amp;amp;= e n + a, \end{align}$$
which is provided by the saddle_node_ibm model in populationdynamics.
For each of the warning signal statistics in question, we need to generate the distibution over all replicates and then over replicates which have been selected conditional on having experienced a crash.</description>

      <description>Writing  Meeting with Steve over outline Writing on nonparametric-bayes manuscript A few notes on notebook-features draft  Reading  EasyABC by Jabot et. al. (2013). While it&amp;rsquo;s great that MEE publishes this stuff, this is unique in that the authors are updating and improving upon an existing package published by MEE the year before, Brook et. al. (2013). The authors of the recent manuscript have certainly made an important contribution which deserves the traditional recognition provided by a separate publication, but one must wonder why we need another package instead of building on the existing one.</description>

      <description>Multiple-uncertainty  Created smaller version of table to simplify comparisons Switched to stationary policy comparisons only. (Running out over longer time shifts total value a bit but doesn&amp;rsquo;t amplify scale of the differences much) Larger noise amplifies the effects (compare 0.3 levels to 0.5 levels) note that averaging over replicates gives rather consistent means. The differences between successive runs of the algorithm give results agreeing to the tenths place at least.</description>

 higher rank elephants decrease their movement more in dry, resource-poor season than low rank. Guarding the good territory?

      <description>Writing  Working on nonparametric-bayes.  Reading Interesting PNAS comment from Doney &amp;amp; Sailley, (2013) (&amp;ldquo;When an ecological regime shift is really just stochastic noise&amp;rdquo;) on the Di Lorenzo &amp;amp; Ohman, (2013) piece in the same issue, showing that time integrated zooplankton data correlates closely with environmental drivers: in this case, the pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index, which would be missed by the traditional approach of direct correlations. This refutes the previous explanation of such shifts observed in the krill populations as being driven by nonlinear ecological interactions, rather than merely linearly tracking the environment ((Hare &amp;amp; Mantua, 2000)).</description>

      <description>On Wednesday my comment piece with Alan, Tipping points: from patterns to predictions appeared in Nature (next to a nice comment by Heather Piwowar on NSF&amp;rsquo;s move to recognizing products of research more broadly than publications alone).
Heather has written an excellent post on the process of writing, which rings true with my own experience. Working with an editor with clear expertise in science writing and communication who was otherwise unfamiliar with the details of this field was an immensely rewarding experience, and her contributions really ought to be recognized more clearly.</description>

      <description>Nonparametric Bayes Continuing sensitivity analysis The commit log to sensitivity.md and earlier to myer-exploration.md (now depricated) capture the summary figures for replicate runs of the observation data, with commits corresponding to various parameter configurations, etc. Here is a nice collection of replicates from sensitivity.md
 Harvest during observations Tweaked calculation of observation data given the harvest regime under which observations were taken (simulation was not implementing all harvests).
 Also adjusted norm used in GP (the parametric use log-normal densities in calculating the transition function on the untransformed data.</description>

      <description>Progress mid-October through mid-December 80% Time: nonparametric-bayes The bulk of my time has been spent becoming familiar with the literature on Gaussian Processes and their numerical implementation. I have written my own Gaussian process code from scratch to convince myself of my understanding of the methodology, and explored some of the related numerical issues addressing computational speed and stability.
I then developed an algorithm for applying the Gaussian process inference of the state dynamics to stochastic dynamic programming methods for determining an optimal harvesting policy.</description>

      <description>Comparison of the Gaussian process inference to the true optimum and a parametric estimate.
Comparison across 100 simulations under the policies inferred from each approach show the nearly optimal performance of the GP and the tragic crashes introduced by the parametric management.
Sensitivity analysis Working through an exploratory sensitivity analysis to see GP performance over different parameters.
 Example from 32 replicates   Distribution of yield over replicates shows the parametric model performing rather poorly, while most of the GP replicates perform nearly optimally.</description>

      <description>Trying to think about a more systematic way to go about varying the parameters: the underlying parametric model has 3 parameters for the stock-recruitment curve&amp;rsquo;s deterministic skeleton, plus growth noise. (My first exploratory phase has been just to try different things. See my various tweaks in the history log Clearly time to be more systematic about both running and visualizing the various cases.)
Should I just choose a handful of parameter combinations to test?</description>

      <description>Notes on structure of examples Externalized code so that different example scripts call identical commands for fitting and plotting to avoid duplication of code. Example scripts tend to be pretty text poor at the moment, would probably benefit by better descriptions in the markdown. May still involve redundant and potentially out of date descriptions though.
Currently, externalized code for GP comparison experiments is in gaussian-process-control.R, and is called by may79-example.</description>

      <description>Code gp_transition_matrix for generic multi-dimensional case  Understanding Gaussian Process performance If the estimated recruitment dynamics correspond to population dynamics that are non-persistent (might call this non self-sustaining, but in a rather stricter sense than when Reed (1979) introduced that term), and if no reward is offered at the terminal time point for a standing stock (zero scrap value), the GP dictates the rather counter-intuitive practice of simply removing the stock entirely.</description>

      <description>I am trying to understand the interface for tgp method, but much of it is not well documented (yes, despite reading through the package R manual, two nice vignettes, and a the PhD Thesis describing it.)
Just to get some consistent notation down: consider the case of a Gaussian process with a Gaussian/radial basis function kernel, parameterized as:
$$K(X, X&amp;rsquo;) = \sigma^2 e^{\frac{(X-X&amp;rsquo;)^2}{d}}$$
And observations from $Z = f(X) + \varepsilon$, for which we seek to approximate $f$ as a (multivariate) Gaussian process, $Z | X ~ N(\mu, C)$.</description>

      <description>Straight-forward tasks can sometimes take forever. In advance of our upcoming conference call for the Pretty Darn Good Control (pdg-control) NIMBioS working group, I had a few remaining issues to touch up in Figures 3 and 4.
Figure 3 shows harvest and stock dynamics under the different functional forms fo the cost. The goal is to provide a very intuitive, visual sense of how the policies differ under these different functional forms, such as a fixed &amp;ldquo;transaction fee&amp;rdquo; (fixed) or a cost that is proportional to the size of the change in policy (L1), or the square of that change (L2), etc.</description>

      <description>Resolving Numerical and Computational issues Sequential approach? (issue #4) Thinking through whether or not it is worth optimizing the computational performance of the sequential approach.
Can it be demonstrated that this actually has higher numerical stability? Alternatively, can it be demonstrated that this is (or is not) equivalent to the calculation performed by the direct inversion? What is the difference in computational complexity between these approaches? e.g. the inverse ends up effectively O(n^3), but what is the recursion?</description>

Can I really calculate $P(y_3 | (y2 | y_1))$ in place of $P(y_3 | y2, y1)$? e.g. instead of calculating:  $$V_3 = K(y_3, y3) - K(y{1:2}, y3) K(y{1:2}, y_{1:2})^{-1} ) K(y3, y{1:2}) $$
Is there some scalar $v_2$ such that

      <description>Consider a stock $x_t$ at time $t$ that recruits stochastically following harvest $h_t$ from the escaped population ($s_t := x_t - ht$), $x{t+1} = z_g f(s_t)$, where $z_g$ is a multiplicative stochastic shock to the growth. We imagine the decision maker sets a policy determining the harvest quota $q_t$ each year, which is implemented as the real harvest with some error $z_i$, $h_t = z_i q_t$. Before setting a quota, the decision maker assesses the stock $y_t = z_m x_t$, so $y$ is a noisy measurement of the true stock $x$.</description>

      <description>Here we work out an SDP solution of the Reed (1979) using a Gaussian process approximation. In this example the Gaussian process hyper-parameters haven&amp;rsquo;t been tuned, so in principle the solution would perform even better, but this is just for illustrative purposes.
We simulate 40 points under a stochastic growth (lognormal multiplicative noise) Beverton-Holt model and infer the Gaussian process. We start the simulation from a low stock value, giving reasonable but not perfect coverage of the state-space.</description>

Recent papers in early warning signals This invistigation is in a very similar spirit to two other recent papers on the subject. Kéfi et al. addresses a different kind of false positive for early warning signals, arising in systems approaching other transitions or bifurcations than the intended culprit, the saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <description>Two years ago, I scribbled an entry into my notebook entitled Wrong Picture, Wrong Model: Why warning signals don&amp;rsquo;t look like rare events. Months later I made some off-hand remark to Alan (my Ph.D. mentor) about how transitions found in historical records, such as the Climate examples in Dakos et. al. (2008), could actually be selecting for stochastic transitions, and this selection process might make them look like traditional warning signals &amp;ndash; i.</description>

We consider adding additional sources of noise through observation error and implementation error to the orginal model of Reed (1979), which considers only growth error. This follows in the line of exploration taken by Clark and Kirkwood (1987), Roughgarden (1996) and Sethi (2006).</description>

 managed warning is the current direct test of this, but needs decently ranged input example where detection has a good chance to succeed.

      <description>pdg-control Value of information Exploring causes for deviation from S = D in the Reed model: arises from self-sustaining assumption. Working out the interpretation of the self-sustaining clause, which sounds like it needs to ensure that the stock is non-decreasing in the absence of harvest,
$$ P(X_{t+1} \geq x | X_n = x ) = 1 $$
This sounds like a very awkward condition to enforce for a non-trivial escapement level \( x = S \).</description>

      <description>Seems that the level of caution observed in the deterministic scenario relative to the increasing noise scenarios comes, perhaps not surprisingly, from the addition of harvesting costs, rather than from overcompensatory dynamics or the asymmetric forms of the noise, which seem to have quantitative but not qualitative differences.

      <description>Our paper, limits to the detection of early warning signals for critical transitions, has now appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Interface. An open-access copy is available under CC-by license on the ArXiv. The essence of the paper is to bring a more model-based approach to early warning signals, while seeking to remain as general as possible.
Without a model-based approach, it is difficult to leverage statistically meaningful comparisons to identify what is a real warning signal and what is just noise.</description>

      <description>Value of information The motivation for this &amp;ldquo;value of information&amp;rdquo; excercise comes from Costello et al. (2010), which essentially compares two scenarios: the value of a marine protected area when you the dispersal kernel is unknown (one of a discrete set of possible kernels you sum over), to the value of the protected area when the kernel is known perfectly. No intrinsic stochasticity, single time step, no learning.

      <description>Mostly getting Prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s Fallacy example to run with large enough sample sizes. Finer sampling or more replicates than current settings seems to crash MPI connections over farm cluster, probably a memory issue. Oh well, looks like I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good enough sample size here.

      <description>pdg-control After reading Costello et. al. (2010), taking a look at value of information in a dynamic context. Consider the model of Sethi et. al. (2005) (Costello is part of et al); a dynamic fisheries model with stochastic growth (a la Reed, (1979)), stochastic measurement assessing the stock size, and stochastic implementation of the harvest. I first imagine the case where the real system is quite deterministic, say, with a tiny amount of growth stochasticity only.</description>

      <description>Chris Costello Talk Presents unpublished work on value of (behavioral) adaptation, using forestry practices changing under climate change as the example. If we ignore adaptive responses, we overestimate costs and underestimate benefits.
 Effect w/ adaptation:  $$ \frac{d V}{d \theta} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \frac{\partial r }{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} $$
 Envelope theorem: optimal point is at ( df/dr = 0 ), so no value of adaptation after optimizing with respect to r.</description>

      <description>Markdown over latex? knitr may have solved the fundamental challenge of all Sweave/latex users with Markdown. Too many of us must be able to work with collaborators who don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX and journals that won&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX. It&amp;rsquo;s a sad state of the affairs, and has improved slowly for journals (at least many will take pdfs for initial submissions) if not for collaborators. Consequently getting away from LaTeX would be nice, but Word or Google docs just won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>

      <description>Have finally gotten my active adaptive management solutions working.
The active adaptive management solution learns very quickly and rather monotonically which model is correct, even when models differ by small amounts and the initial belief is heavily skewed to the wrong model. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented examples with Myers model, but in this parameter space the allee effect is well below the Reed escapement level of the alternative Beverton Holt model, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exert itself.</description>

      <description>Ecologists/TREE (Fischer et. al. 2009), (Polasky et. al. 2011) give a nice overview/introduction to the problem. Perhaps most interestingly, both set up resilience approaches as a foil or alternate approach in contrast to a decision-theoretic problem. Fischer&amp;rsquo;s group does a particularly nice job handling the case that these two are separate approaches &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dismiss resilience thinking as fuzzy optimization of fuzzy objective functions.
The Polasky piece does a nice job refocusing us on the obvious but brushed-over question of the objective function.</description>

      <description>Spent way more of today than I wanted to hammering out the active adaptive management implementation for a trivial model-choice problem using the discretized belief-SDP approach.
We have alternate models $f_1$ and $f2$ of the state equations (population growth dynamics) $$ x{t+1} = z_t f(x_t) $$ and introduce a continuously valued belief probability $p$ that model 1 is correct. This lends itself to a Bayesian updating rule for our belief based on observing a transition from $x$ to $y$,</description>

      <description>Trivial example of a non-optimal but more robust policy by editing the optimal strategy directly. Note in particular that this outperforms the optimal strategy economically as well as ecologically (fewer crashed populations).
 Running the policy-costs model with Beverton Holt instead of the Myers function seems to give a clearer picture of a system responding to policy costs. The single-replicate picture probably captures this better than the policy/replicate visualizations.</description>

      <description>forage fish seminar - Patrick and Jay with interesting stuff. Sounds like compensating benefits due to quality-response (larger fish) and stock effect (easier to find) will be more minor in this fishery, but demand response be compensating.  knit hooks externalization example working (based on Reed.R). Still unsure how I feel about externalization vs fully literate code. Redundant typing is bad but isn&amp;rsquo;t that why common tasks are functionalized?</description>

      <description>Visiting the question of communicating uncertainty in Marissa&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting, focusing on this excellent Science article (Spiegelhalter et. al. 2011). Noam and Jamie are leading the discussion, and suggested we pick a few favorite examples. None on my list really address the challenge of communicating uncertainty directly, though the first one probably comes closest. I think they do highlight some of the potential and the challenges of good data visualization though, which is certainly one of the essential building blocks to visual communication of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Surprising heterogeneity of profit distribution under a simple Beverton-Holt model Usually I expect the alternate stable state dynamics to be the ones producing bimodal distribution of profit:
The pattern is driven by a costs to harvesting making harvest unprofitable most of the time, while chance fluctuations push some populations across this threshold again and again. The ensemble variation in harvest is suggestive of this:
but we really see what is going on when we color-code the population dynamics of the most profitable and least profitable realizations of the stochastic dynamics:</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve simulated 1000 replicates of a system that has alternative stable states, but is not approaching the bifurcation. I&amp;rsquo;ve added enough noise (demographic stochasticity in this case, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what) that 129&amp;frasl;1000 transition stochastically to the bad state, so I have decent sample sizes in each. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m finding: If I condition on having crashed (i.e. take the 129 that transition) and apply our model-based early warning signal, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t detect any early warning sign.</description>

 People get amazed by power laws but never by normal distributions. Seems like some max ent outcomes astonish while others don&amp;rsquo;t. When so many mechanisms aggregate to common densities, I&amp;rsquo;d hope we&amp;rsquo;d stop trying to argue that we can go backwards from pattern to process so easily.

      <description>Abstract The recog­ni­tion that ecosys­tems can undergo sud­den shifts to alter­nate, less desir­able sta­ble states has led to the desire to iden­tify early warn­ing signs of these impend­ing col­lapses. Motivated by the math­e­mat­ics of bifur­ca­tions, the search for early warn­ing signs seeks to detect subtle patterns that may precede these shift. Faced with limited and imperfect data, such forecasting is fraught with uncertainty. I will present work illustrating how we can quantify the risks of false alarms and missed detection of these early warning signals, and illustrate how this information can be used to inform robust decision-making that may avoid collapse.</description>

 1&amp;frasl;27: Carl: optimal vs. actionable management recommendations 2&amp;frasl;3: Jaime/Noam(?): monitoring for management 2&amp;frasl;10: Allison: informing management vs. advocacy 2&amp;frasl;17: Lewis: what types of research are must useful to management 2&amp;frasl;24: Noam/Jaime: communicating uncertainty 3&amp;frasl;2: Marissa: funding sources for applied research, building collaborations outside academia, and service opportunities ((this is one of the days of the PFMC meeting in Sacramento, which would be rather relevant to our theme, so we might push this topic to next quarter)) 3&amp;frasl;9: Emil: obstacles to implementing scientific advise 3&amp;frasl;16: Scott: the quality of science along the basic-applied spectrum (perceptions and reality)  Also shared some coding tricks and ways to share them.</description>

      <description>The optimal policy with symmetric L1 costs to changing the quotas results in the solutions that stop changing, sometimes at no harvest (if there&amp;rsquo;s scrap value), or at some fixed high harvest if no scrap value. (See earlier notes). Asymmetric costs of comparable magnitude result in more crashes.
When we apply an L1 norm cost of the same magnitude as before for decreasing quotas, but allow increasing quotas to be free (no cost to environmental lobby), the solution follows the Reed optimum is in purple (harvest_alt) (cost-free adjustment), while the blue is the harvest level being implemented with a cost:</description>

      <description>pdg-control  plots for changing costs Report out to Training Problem II group.  ggplot note defining functions that return a ggplot object can be tricky. If you compute some objects in the plot function (stats etc), those stats are not stored by the object (due to lazy evaluation, usually a very nice time-saving feature), so the plot cannot be produced unless the function returns those things to the global environment (or from wherever the plot will be printed/evaluated).</description>

      <description>Considering the case where there is a cost to changing the harvest quota (representing the cost of efforts to change policy). We can imagine several scenarios that could introduce this:
 Fixed cost to change
 Cost proportional to the size of the change (L1 norm)
 Cost proportional to the square of the size (L2 norm, i.e. small changes aren&amp;rsquo;t expensive, large ones are very expensive)
 asymmetric costs &amp;ndash; lowering quotas may be harder than raising them</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now computing the optimal solution under three sources of noise (compare with my earlier examples of calculating the optimal solution assuming only growth noise, but simulating dynamics with other noise sources). See the statement of problem details, essentially:
$$ \max_{ { q_t } \leq 0 } \mathbb{E} \left{ \sum_0^{\infty} \alpha^t h_t \right} $$ s.t. Fish population follows: $ x_t = zt^g f( x{t-1} - h_{t-1} ) $ and measured stock is given by: $ m_t = z_t^m x_t $ while harvest is: $ h_t = \min (x_t, z_t^i q_t) $ Where $ z^g $ denotes uncertainty in population growth, $ z^m $ denotes uncertainty in measurement for the stock assessment, and $ z^i $ denotes uncertainty in harvest implementation.</description>

      <description>Adding stochasticity seems to have a small history.
Reed 1979 Reed, 1979 Uncertainty in next year&amp;rsquo;s stock, &amp;ldquo;growth uncertainty&amp;rdquo; at the time of determining harvest. Constant escapement policy, no chance of extinction.
Clark &amp;amp; Kirkwood 1986 Clark &amp;amp; Kirkwood, 1986 Uncertainty in this year&amp;rsquo;s stock, &amp;ldquo;measurement uncertainty&amp;rdquo; when determining harvest.
Roughgarden &amp;amp; Smith (1996) consider both, and add uncertainty in harvest. Sethi et al. 2005 (Sethi et. al. 2005) consider the economist&amp;rsquo;s optimization of this.</description>

      <description>I consider the optimal stochastic-dynamic programming solution for the model specified with known stochasticity in population dynamics, but now vary the actual simulated dynamics to include further uncertainty or error not included in the optimal solution in different ways. In some way this is an &amp;ldquo;unfair&amp;rdquo; analysis, as I really should be solving for the optimal solution in light of the fully uncertain space, but in practice this at least serves as a sensitivity analysis to the assumptions that certain quantities are perfectly known.</description>

      <description>Modeling choices Allee effect model: Myers Beverton-Holt with harvesting-effort mortality:
$$ x_{t+1} = f(x) = \frac{a x_t^{\alpha}}{1+ x_t^{\alpha}/b} - e x $$ For $ \alpha = 2 $, equilibrium points are $ x = 0 $ and
$$ x = \frac{ab}{2(1+e)} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left(\frac{ab}{1+e}\right)^2-4b } $$
As written this differs from our earlier solutions a couple respects &amp;ndash; the growth function applies to the unharvested population, which then experiences harvesting mortality, and the control variable is fishing effort, not harvest.</description>

      <description>Dakos (Dakos et. al. 2012) considers $ \tfrac{dx}{dt} = f(x,p) $ and perturbs the parameter randomly to introduce variation. Evaluating around an equilibrium where $ f(x^, p^) = 0 $, they expand to first order (citing (Ripa &amp;amp; Heino, 1999)):
$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \partial_x f(x^,p^)(x-x^) + \partial_p f(x^,p^) (p - p^) $$
and taking $ \xi = x- x^* $, with some slight of hand argue this can be rewritten as an Ito process,</description>

      <description>Starting with Reed 1979 Reed, 1979. Consider the stochastic population growth model
$$ X_{t+1} = Z_n f(X_n) $$
$ f(x) $ is concave and non-decreasing (compensating, not over-compensating). A natural choice is the Beverton-Holt model,
$$ f(x) = \frac{A x}{1+B x} $$
Cost of harvest is Schaefer production function $ c(x) = k/q x $, (i.e. doubling fish density halves the cost, assume $q $ constant), or Cobbs-Douglas form $ c(x) = k/x^{\theta} $ where $ \theta = 1+\beta \leq 1$.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We consider the stochastic optimal control problem of fisheries harvests under the scenarios involving alternate stable states, with uncertainty about the parameters of harvest. We consider a series of introductory problems to prepare us for the full problem. We begin with classical optimal control approaches (Pontraygin&amp;rsquo;s principle to transform into an ordinary differential equation boundary-value problem) for continuous time state equations (fish population dynamics) as a reference point.</description>

      <description>Andrew has put together the preliminary API for the openfisheries.org project. I&amp;rsquo;ve begun an R package, rfisheries, to interface to the openfisheries project. It would be great to incorporate data from the RAM Legacy database and the seaaroundus.org project, which may be done at the level of the R package or (perhaps more flexibly) directly through the developing openfisheries API.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick proof-of-principle example for Andrew&amp;rsquo;s API:

      <description>Discrete-time state equation Discrete-time solution appears to be all about dynamic programming
and a chance for me to remember that I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice writing recursive functions. It&amp;rsquo;s just that in thinking about the problem, you start from the end, with the trivial subcase, and keep adding the layers. But the recursive function kinda starts at the beginning, and that trivial case is the exit condition. R doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very efficient with these recursive functions, so this might become a C sub-routine eventually.</description>

      <description>Optimal Control by Pontryagin principle Problem statement  State equation: $\dot x = x \exp \left( \alpha \left(1-\frac{x}{K}\right) \left( \frac{x-C}{K} \right) \right) - x h$
 Utility function $\pi(h, x, t) = \frac{h^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$
 Boundary constraints: $x(0) = X_0 \qquad x(T) = X_T$
  See problem statement and analytic BVP formulation details in this post. Additionally we scale the variables appropriately. Then we can begin with some basic parameter exploration in the original model formulation.</description>

      <description>pdg-control Problem statement: Maximize profits subject to $$\max_{h(t)} \int_0^T e^{-\rho t} \pi(x, h, t) dt $$ Subject to the state equations (biology):
$$ \dot x = x \exp \left( \alpha \left(1-\frac{x}{K}\right) \left( \frac{x-C}{K} \right) \right) - x h $$
Note that we consider the control variable to be effort, $h$ instead of harvest, $\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{H} = h x$.
and the constraints: $$ x(0) = X_0 \qquad x(T) = X_T $$ We have fixed boundary conditions (equalities) and equalities in the state equations, so we have a nice straight-forward problem.</description>

      <description>Optimal control Imagine we&amp;rsquo;re trying to minimize $J = \theta( y(t_F), t_F)$
subject to both the state equations: $\dot y = f(y(t), u(t))$, Note these are continuous, applying at all times $t$.
and boundary conditions: $\psi(y(t_F), u(t_F), t_F) = 0$. These are discrete, applying only at fixed time $t_F $. We have to put the continuous constraint in as an integral:
$$ \hat J = \left[\phi + \mathbf{\nu}^T \psi \right]_{tF} - \int{t_I}^{t_F} \mathbf{\lambda}^T \left(\dot{\mathbf{y}} - f(\mathbf{y}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)) \right) dt $$</description>

      <description>Consider a harvested fish population with discrete-time population dynamics under an allee effect:
$$ N_{t+1} = N_t \exp \left( \gamma \left[ 1-\frac{N_t}{K} \right] \left[ \frac{N_t - C}{K} \right] \right) - \beta E_h N_t$$
Note that C is the unfished allee threshold, K the carrying capacity, $E_h$ the fish harvesting effort.
Consider that the initial population is unknown, but described by a density function whose variance can be decreased by sampling. Just to get started, let&amp;rsquo;s assume log-normal (avoiding the chance of negative population sizes), with log-standard deviation inversely proportional to the sampling effort $E_s $.</description>

      <description>Very interesting article on tipping points that seems to answer a question I put to Vasilis back in 2009 at IIASA: whether critical transitions due to bifurcations could be distinguished from stochastic transitions due to rare events Ditlevsen &amp;amp; Johnsen, 2010. Argues that some of the well-known climate transitions may have been stochastic transitions instead. Will need a closer read to better assess how they are distinguishing between such transitions in the data.</description>

My own highlights certainly include Steve Pacala&amp;rsquo;s fantastic plenary session in receiving the MacArthur award, and Mark Urban&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear presentation on &amp;ldquo;climate collisions.&amp;rdquo; I thought I was less tolerant of data-free models with arbitrary assumptions these days, but somehow Mark just swept those concerns away. In pointing out really fundamental concepts, such details just aren&amp;rsquo;t so important.</description>

      <description>What you want to look for are stock assessments. For example, for the species closest to home, under the Pacific Fisheries Management Council:
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/archived-stock-assessments/
Three rockfish species that might be good to look into for your purposes are widow, yelloweye, and bocaccio, but these will have shorter-term data than any of the cod data. Also, NOAA NMFS Technical Reports on individual stocks often have long appendices with lots of data.</description>

      <description>Marissa mentioned looking into some of the fisheries data for early warning signals: particularly the Canadian Cod collapse.
Apparently several of the data sets are problematic. All deal with catch instead of abundance and measurement error is highly significant, though it seems that some may suffer from more troublesome systematic errors. Taking a quick look over what is available. Lots of data, but despite what appears to be some rather sophisticated tools available on the sites, I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of difficulty finding just what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the model choice/model adequacy section of the appendix. This is the section that Reviewer 2 said needed further development, which would be beyond the scope of this paper:
 Here the authors claim that by using particular structural models based on assumptions about underlying dynamics their method makes it easy to identify cases that do not conform to the assumptions. It would be interesting to evaluate this claim but it would require a substantial amount of analysis that may be beyond the scope of a short paper.</description>

      <description>Working on ESA presentation. See slides and code for details.
 Adding movie a time series which gets longer (and closer to collapse) each frame, with corresponding warning signals for the interval thus far shown below (for CV and autocorrelation). Include sparsely sampled (100) and densely sampled (1000) examples. Compare always using a sliding window-size equal to half the length of the available data (works well on longer time series) to a fixed-width sliding window (doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well ever).</description>

      <description>The Gillespie algorithm has two parts: (1) determine what event happens, (2) determine when it happens. Consider the system of equations $$ \dot X_i = f_i(\vec X) $$
where the $f_i$ give the rates of creation and annihilation (negative and postive parts of $f_i(\vec X)$ must be listed seperately) for all species $x_i$. We assume this gives the mean rate at which each event occurs, drawn from on exponential distribution. We could simply draw the associated random exponential time for each reaction, and pick the minimum for which event occurs.</description>

      <description>oikos post launch case of increased sampling on sim data for autocorrelation (is our approach more robust to model differences?)  IBM data Example Using data from the individual-based model simulation of a system approaching a saddle-node.
Variance While the initial example with variance shows almost no signal, increasing the sampling effort substantially improves the performance. This can be seen in the ROC curves and as a tightening and spreading out of the null and test distributions as the sampling effort is increased.</description>

      <description>Looking at ways to visually explain receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Should probably be done in a way that maps the curves to the points along the curve. May make a nice graphic but perhaps unnecessary.
Perhaps simpler to present as single panel Integrating the test distribution to the left instead of the right gives the error rate (Type I/Type II errors, False Alarms/Missed Events):

      <description>In preparing manuscript on warning signals, reviewing the literature on when statistical validation of the warning signal is included, and if so, what kind are done. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly no consensus in the approach, with the majority of papers not even attempting a method (and those that do not finding significance). Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s key review (Scheffer et. al. 2009) calls for the need to measure statistical significance of warning signals,
 Therefore, it would be useful to build a set of reliable statistical procedures to test whether an increase in autocorrelation, for example, is significant.</description>

 created a quick mcmcTools package so different packages can use my custom routines. Will have to explore some of the standard packages eventually, though most seem somewhat specialized (the Bayesian task-view is epic). bayesm looks promising, and LearnBayes package that accompanies Jim Albert&amp;rsquo;s book (Albert, unknown) might be worth a closer look.
 Wrote mcmc script for warningsignals, much more debugging to handle out-of-bounds conditions then expected.</description>

  Seminar on Species trees Coop/Moore Seminar on *BEAST (Heled &amp;amp; Drummond, 2009) and BEST (Liu et. al. 2008).
Essential differences: BEST uses Mr. Bayes to compute probabilities over gene trees (over uniform prior). Then estimates the species tree by importance sampling from this distribution to reflect constraints under a convergence model. Integrates over effective population sizes rather than estimating (highly uncertain anyway), requires rooting, and a rather fast/loose implementation of ultra-metricizing trees.</description>

      <description>Alan and I have been considering analyzing a particular system for early warning signals where we could highlight risk management from an economics stand-point, probably with the help of Jim Sanchirico. Our current work focuses on quantifying the relative risk of false alarms and missed detections. While statisticians typically accept a 5% &amp;ldquo;false alarm&amp;rdquo; rate, we argue this given limited data this is always a trade-off against the missed detection rate and hence the location of this threshold should properly a decision of management, not of convention.</description>

      <description>Trying a different set-up for the graphs. Added two additional datasets, trying layout of making all three figures into a panels in a single figure.
Concerns:
 Better than only one empirical example, but not sure that the three Glaciation data sets add that much since they are all quite similar. Five panels wide might be too much. Don&amp;rsquo;t have an example where a transition is about to occur but the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t have adequate power even for our Likelihood method, third panel.</description>

      <description>Fixed bug causing montecarlotest() calls not to complete: in likelihood_bifurcation_models, LTC error checking uses any() to see if any Vx are negative, returns NA if none are negative but has NAs. rm.na=TRUE fixed this. GetParNames works, probably worth an appendix section to discuss parameter bootstraps as well, particularly in the cases of low power. Updated codes to turn this flag back on and am re-running. Figure3 plot has been using the 160 bootstrap replicates, updated to the 2000 replicates.</description>

ibm_sim.R &amp;ndash; simulate from individual-based dynamics containing a saddle-node bifurcation (fully hysteresis model).
ibm_analysis.R &amp;ndash; run figure1, 2, 3 analysis (correlation test, bootstrap of test, likelihood test) on each data.
ibm_likelihood.R &amp;ndash; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be needed, all code is in deut_examples.R. Running now due to earlier parallel instance errors during montecarlotest.</description>

 Must figure out what data examples are going into the supplement. Most should be reasonably straight-forward to set up, may take a while to run.
 Have to figure out what to say about likelihood-based statistical method beyond definition of Cox&amp;rsquo;s delta,</description>

      <description>Read over Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s rather nice introduction(Scheffer, 2010) to the Drake paper(Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010). Last paragraph is particularly pertinenant:
 Clearly, we have just scratched the surface in exploring the possibilities and limitations of this emerging field. However, the prospect of identifying generic indicators is exciting, as the approach may provide an independent way to assess the risk of critical transitions. Expansion of our toolbox for prediction is especially welcome given the almost insurmountable problem of modelling complex systems in a quantitatively accurate way.</description>

Ergodicity Null of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau/rank correlations &amp;ndash; independence of X and Y, not satisfied even over replicates. Adjusted codes to use Pearson&amp;rsquo;s (default option, need to pass option up to higher-level functions). Repeated Figure 2 plots with Pearson&amp;rsquo;s, results not much different, funny multimodal though:
Actually verifying independence is rather more challenging, though convenient in this case that a test such as Pearson&amp;rsquo;s is not designed to do this, see http://en.</description>

      <description>Reading Some nice theoretical ecology papers out from our group recently, looking over today:
 Paul&amp;rsquo;s paper (Williams &amp;amp; Hastings, 2011) deals with some interesting work on persistence in complex models, (stochastic systems of mixture models), curious how it compares to the conclusions of (Schreiber, 2010).
 Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s paper (Schreiber et. al. 2011) with Dan Bolnick and Burger, another example of the importance of individual heterogeneity, this time in a nice phenotype/genotype specific way by combining quantitative genetics approaches with predator dynamics.</description>

      <description>Summary Paragraph
 Critical transitions exist (Holling, 1973), (May, 1977),(Scheffer et. al. 2001) Warning signals exist (Scheffer et. al. 2009), (Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010) Warning signals are summary statistics, critical slowing down (Wissel, 1984). Statement of general problem: double-edged sword &amp;ndash; no quantification of the chance detection scheme will fail. We provide a way to do this We find existing methods lack sufficient power and have high false-alarm potential We provide a model-based solution using machinery of modern likelihood statistics  Background  Define CSD, standard detection scheme.</description>

      <description>Working on more examples for the notebook. Currently exploring a collection of simulated examples. In particular, would be useful to have simulated examples that look as realistic in data-density as possible (i.e. fewer sample points, also shorter sampling interval relative to timescale, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a fuzzy caterpillar. Second, would be good to include examples on data simulated from non-linearized systems made to represent some richer bifurcation examples. Finally it would be good to include as many real-data examples as reasonable.</description>

Should emphasize the countless and utterly arbitrary choices made in every one of these analyses. Should emphasize our approach can be applied without replicates. (also without interpolating/having evenly sampled data) Should do coefficient of variation on non-detrended data(?) should discuss?

      <description>Variance and warning signals Sebastian has several examples of dynamical systems that decrease in variance as they approach a bifurcation. In some sense this is not surprising, both are through the collapse of periodic attractors. Figure 2d in TPB paperSchreiber, 2003 has an example in a discrete system, and Figure 5a in the Ecology Letters paper (Schreiber &amp;amp; Rudolf, 2008) has a continuous-time example. Consider for instance the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, in which a stable limit cycle vanishes into an unstable node, as in a van der Pol oscillator,</description>

      <description>Added bar of observed tau on real data to the tau distributions. Fixed the tau-distribution method, running new data and real examples now.
Simulated data: can tell tau apart for instance, for autocorrelation (see photostream for variance, code hash for parameters, etc). While can&amp;rsquo;t really tell anything based on the tau on the autocorrelation for the Deuterium data for Glaciation III (which has just about the clearest signal of the deuterium set): Waiting to see how the likelihood statistics compare on these examples.</description>

      <description>Worried about accurate maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, as the optimization could still converge on values not far from the starting conditions (not as surprising as the starting parameters are estimated intelligently first from the summary statistics) but could also vary depending on initial conditions.
Second, while it requires some re-parameterization, the stationary model for both linearized transcritical (LTC) bifurcation model and the linearized saddle-node (LSN) model are identically Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models.</description>

      <description>Working on a little data exploration while writing up manuscript. I have been puzzled why it appears that most estimates of tau on the CaCO3 data infer negative correlation, as in
Despite the fact that there seems to be a loss of stability in the model:
require(warningsignals) load(&amp;quot;CaCO3.Rdat&amp;quot;) timedep$pars Ro m theta sigma 8.36841588 -0.03347119 -2.86194248 282.03234042  So m is negative, so that the system is loosing stability, but only very gradually.</description>

Greenhouse Earth, CaCO3 data:
Glaciation I-IV (deuterium data)
These use the unadjusted timeseries, and hence don&amp;rsquo;t reproduce the values of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau statistic reported in (Dakos et. al. 2008). In fact they don&amp;rsquo;t even agree on the sign &amp;ndash; visually many of the datasets are certainly decreasing in variance. I ran the Monte-Carlo distributions for tau on models estimated from these data-sets with and without warning, for variance (left) and autocorrelation (right), in the CaCO3 data:</description>

      <description>Continuing my tweaks to code to apply warning signals to the climate data used in (Dakos et. al. 2008). After adjusting my code to deal with variably spaced sampling intervals, I reread the supplement &amp;ndash; I had forgotten that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually consider data with variable time-scales, but instead interpolate the curves to have equally spaced sampling intervals.
Obviously this is not ideal. It is true that the autocorrelation would be impacted by non-equally spaced data, while there is no reason to do so for the variance indicator.</description>

As Hypothesis Testing Null = isn&amp;rsquo;t a loss of stability (distribution produced by the MLE model of no stability loss), hypothesis = there is (distribution produced by, MLE model with stability loss) determine p value for falsely rejecting the null and the power of the statistical test.</description>

      <description>In at 8:30. 10a and still getting through Google Reader journals, emails.
 Finished up yesterday&amp;rsquo;s entry and posted. Exploring some of the new developments in Wordpress for scientists. Some trouble with the link2link code interfacing with kcite. No luck yet on mathjax: renders the shortcode instead of the equations, i.e $dx = \sigma d B_t$ NIMBioS workshop inquiry: Offering a workshop on HPC in R, I was curious about the scope and depth of the workshop.</description>

      <description>Morning has been rather difficult trying to get simulations up and running. Parallel library isn&amp;rsquo;t running on zero or one, variety of errors that seemed to be machine dependent and reminiscent of the ~./sfCluster problem, 3 hrs of debugging revealed this was indeed just a bug in my updated code. (In changing to my object-oriented simulate.gauss and update.gauss functions rather than calling the specific functions directly I hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated all the function calls).</description>

      <description>Going several directions at once in tweaking the warning signals code to make sure I have clear comparisons that are not resulting from any limitations in the numerical algorithms. Performing a variety of error checks, etc:
 Comparing fixed models vs comparing models estimated from the data
 Ensure that const model doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to estimate m (doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact likelihood anyway
 Ensure only positive values of sigma are returned (trying use trigger in setLTC and setLSN to return infinite variance if sigma is negative)</description>

      <description>Continuing to explore examples
Some difficulty in the &amp;ldquo;snowfall&amp;rdquo; parallel computation engine, removing the ~/.sfCluster directory seems to reset the error &amp;ldquo;unable to unserialize nodes&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo; Also don&amp;rsquo;t have good handling of variable names for tracking the boostrapping of parameters. For the moment have just added a toggle to suppress these to avoid dim mismatch in rownames command. Strange that this happens to the indicator_vs_likelihood code but not to the nearly-identical call to montecarlotest() in lin_bifur_models.</description>

      <description>Continuing writing and experimentation for examples in the warning signals manuscript, figuring out how to explain the need for the likelihood-based model comparison approach rather than the standard method of summary statistics.
The traditional approach computes a particular &amp;ldquo;leading indicator&amp;rdquo;, such as variance or autocorrelation, in a sliding window along the time series. If the system is loosing stability approaching a bifurcation, it&amp;rsquo;s leading eigenvalue must go through zero and hence shows critical slowing down, with the associated pattern of increasing autocorrelation an increasing variance.</description>

      <description>Simulations completed, help accentuate the different paths for branching. When the most failures occur while waiting for the first mutation to enter first established dimorphism, mutation rate seems limiting (left):
(right) With a higher mutation rate, most collapses back to monomorphism occur after a mutation successfully invades in the dimorphic population. Unfortunately these runs result in large fraction of the ensemble never reaching the final branching, those that do, do so fast:</description>

      <description>My last post was a bit pessimistic, sometimes I can still miss the forest for the trees. Hidden in those figures, the main point has been staring me in the face. So let&amp;rsquo;s try this again.
Stochastic limits to evolutionary branching is the story of two dueling timescales. The first timescale is that of the evolutionary process: the frequency of steps (mutation rate, $ \mu$) and the size of the steps (mutation kernel standard deviation $ \sigma_{\mu}$), on top of which we add the selection gradient, created by the ecology.</description>

      <description>Ran a series of simulations overnight to explore aspects of time-to-branching at different phases of the branching process. Still using only 16 replicates per data point, though increased maximum time for a run another order of magnitude to avoid timing out runs influencing the dataset for the slow-rate parameters. Still seems to suggest a regime beyond which branching becomes completely improbable. Not clear that the transition is a sharp as the Arrhenius approximation might suggest.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I derived the linearized SDEs for the saddle node bifurcation :
$$ dX = 2\sqrt{r(t)} (\sqrt{r(t)} + \theta -X) dt + \sigma \sqrt{\sqrt{r(t)}+\theta} dB_t $$
and the transcritical bifurcation
$$ dX = r(t) (K - X) dt + \sqrt{K} dB_t $$
Now to implement them for fitting by likelihood using generic $ r(t) $. I go back to the warning() model implemented in sde_likelihood.R code. We can just solve the odes directly:</description>

      <description>Have spent the last three days building and testing the infrastructure to fit the canonical form of a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation by likelihood. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t use the canonical form straight up: $ dx/dt = x^2 +r$ cannot be fit directly in this manner, since it needs a couple scale transformations on the variables to get the units right (a multiple for the unit scale and an additive factor for the zero point), and more importantly, isn&amp;rsquo;t a stochastic model so cannot assign probabilities to the outcomes.</description>

[flickr-gallery mode=&amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; tags=&amp;ldquo;quadraticfitslides&amp;rdquo; tag_mode=&amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo;]
Analysis of fits Of course these fits rely entirely on mapping the location of the stable point and the slope through that point, something they still cannot do all that well. In this parameterization the the stable intercept is $$ \hat x = \sqrt{r}+\theta $$ and slope at intercept is $$ \frac{\partial f(\hat x)}{\partial x} = -2\sqrt{r} $$ This creates a numerical optimization problem, since there is high importance on getting the mean right, and less on the variance, the routine tends to fix the combination of r and theta to get the mean right, and then cannot change r to get the slope correct without getting penalized for the loss of likelihood in changing the mean.</description>

      <description>Working from the quadratic model for the saddle node bifurcation rather than the linear (OU) model. Recall that the dynamics are:
$$dX = \left( r - (x-\theta)^2\right)dt + \beta \sqrt{X} dB_t $$
and the linear noise approximation gives a linear Fokker Planck equation such that the probability distribution is Gaussian with moments ((corrected from yesterday to scale noise, basically as pure-birth Poisson process))
$$\frac{d \hat{x}}{dt} &amp;amp;= r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 $$ $$ \frac{d \sigma^2}{dt} &amp;amp;= -2 (\hat x - \theta )\sigma^2 + \beta \left(r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 \right) $$</description>

$$ y(\omega) = \int0^T dt e^{i\omega t} x(t) $$ $$ S(\omega) = \lim{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2\pi T} \left| y(\omega)\right|^2 $$
A little work can show is equal to the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, $ \langle x(t) x(t&amp;rsquo;) \rangle = C(t-t&amp;rsquo;) $.
We evaluate the correlation function of their Fourier transform (note $ x (\omega) $ is really $ \tilde x(\omega)$, the new transformed variable, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the tilde only out of laziness):</description>

      <description>Matching the warning signal to different SDE models couldn&amp;rsquo;t retain the simplicity and generality needed, so I intend to work on the transformed data instead. Taking the power spectrum of the data, we have a new curve fitting problem:
(Code). This can be turned into a linear curve fitting problem by taking the log of the inverse Fourrier transform, then the slope is our stability parameter. Can we do this estimation by likelihood instead of least-squares?</description>

      <description>Consider the first-order autoregressive process: $$ X_{t+1} = \rho X_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}Z_t $$
Why the funny term at the end? This comes from normalizing the variance,
$$ \begin{multline} E( (\rho X_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} Z_t)^2 ) = E (\rho^2 X_t^2) + E(2 \rho X_t \sqrt{1-\rho^2}) Z_t ) + E( X_t^2 Z_t^2 (1-\rho^2) ) \end{multline}$$
by independence:
$$ = \rho^2 E(X_t^2) + 2 \rho \sqrt{1-\rho^2} E( X_t ) E( Z_t ) + E( X_t^2) E(Z_t^2) (1-\rho^2) $$</description>

      <description>The last few days have involved an investigation into the ability to capture the essential features of the dynamics leading up to a saddle node bifurcation as a linear stochastic differential equation. The warning signals question then becomes a model-choice problem between constant and time-dependent coefficients:
$$ dX_t = \alpha \left(\theta_t - X_t\right) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$
and
$$ dX_t = \alpha_t (\theta_t - X_t) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$</description>

      <description>Yesterday I began to address concerns of different models that have different mean dynamics, and how this influences the warning signals. This poses several kinds of issues.
 First, if the mean is changing, the model fitting must be appropriate to this &amp;ndash; either by fitting this rate of change or correcting for it.
 Second, the variance is expected to scale with the mean, and scale differently under different noise models (particularly environmental vs.</description>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden. The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump. The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

 Proper handling of trends

      <description>Noam gave an interesting presentation in our lab today, prompted me to do a little experimentation. Weakening stability across a set of coupled patches should result in increased autocorrelation. Decided to test this with a little visualization with help of a quick R script. Time progresses across the x-axis, 1-D space (on S1) across the y-axis. Each patch suffers a slow loss of stability, resulting in a clearly visible increase in autocorrelation.</description>

      <description>Adaptive dynamics is a set of recently developed techniques for understanding phenotypic evolution, using a dynamical systems approach to concepts from evolutionary game theory. In contrast to population genetics, this approach tends to explore richer ecological interactions and simpler genetic assumptions, with significant controversy. My own work has focused on a particular element of the theory known as the canonical equation, a macroscopic equation describing the deterministic rate of evolution.</description>

      <description>Ecological population sizes fluctuate not only in response to environmental fluctuations but because of the stochastic nature of natural births and deaths. While in very large populations these fluctuations have negligible impact, ecology rarely obliges us by satisfying this limit. Age and stage structure in populations serve to amplify the effect, where the fate of the population is determined by a smaller subset of, say, the fecund adults alone. Demographic noise is probably responsible for the ultimate extinction of many populations once reduced to a small size.</description>

Interpreting μ terms as death events, b as birth, and the a terms as transitions between age classes gives a natural form for the master equation.
Divergent Solutions to the linear noise approximation? Breaking the age classes into k subclasses makes waiting time within an age class gamma instead of exponential, which better matches observation. Also allows sustained oscillations. The numerical solution to the linear noise approximation shows divergent variance dynamics.</description>

Einstein-Smoluchowski debate regarding Langevin correspondence to Ito vs Statonvich representations resolved: [theorem]. (Statonvich is the more natural interpretation of the way in which we measure data to compare to Langevin. Of course Ito and Stratonvich can be mapped back and forth anyway). Of course this difference doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and nothing goes wrong / no stochastic surprises if dynamics are linear.</description>

Required rewriting gillespie function so as to intelligently calculate rates rather than writing 3K+1 functions. This leads to an alternative gillespie simulation interface that takes a function to calculate rates, producing cumulative sum (though perhaps that step should be moved into the raw gillespie code) of rates for each event, and an outcome function that will execute the outcome of each of those events.</description>

      <description>So far no large noise in larval class alone, several potential mechanisms we may have missed so far:  Getting large noise in larva  Noise from egg class (due to nonlinear dynamics) Nonlinearity in larval class due to large larva eating smaller ones Unknown effect of more realistic aging/stage transitions. Long transients? &amp;ndash; Experiments start with larva, pupa, adults to speed up transient period.</description>

      <description>Noise in the larval class is damped by and grows proportional to its intrinsic variation and the contribution of other classes through their derivatives of f~L~, that is, as well as the sum of its intrinsic rates (essentially whichever is larger). Taking E dynamics to be fast we might reduce to a continous time LPA model:  and the larval fluctuations are essentially:
where β~i~ is the intrinsic noise of the age class.</description>

      <description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking the Jacobian of the transition terms. Fixes the unstable behavior and disagreement between simulations and theory. Other note: the &amp;ldquo;hastings.c&amp;rdquo; model can trivially be obtained from the standard crowley-form metapopulation model by taking b_1 = 0.  For the crowley class of models at least, seems that while the two-step vs one-step involved different dynamics, this difference exists only in transients while equilbrium covariances agree.</description>

      <description>Adjusted individual based Crowley model to follow same parameterization as the macroscopic model. IBM rules had divided b and c by K in the dynamics while the macroscopic was just using rescaled dynamical rates. Now both use the rescaled rates as parameter values while the equations match.
 Variation in the Crowley model agrees between individual-based simulation and the equations.

      <description>Fig 1: Noise in lavae dominate
Fig: 2 lower mortality, higher noise
 Success! My first full implementation of the four stage (EPLA) beetle model, so far without any adaptation, and the noise of the larval class dominates (Fig 1). Without the time delays the stationary dynamics are stable nodes, at least in this part of parameter space, with a large adult class clamping tightly down on the other classes.</description>

This provides a good opportunity to summarize the status of my current projects and my principle accomplishments for the year. Will try a tex&amp;rsquo;d document as I&amp;rsquo;ve done in previous years but here&amp;rsquo;s for some preliminary brainstorming.
 Summary: In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published one paper, given 4 talks (CPB, NIMBioS, Berkeley, IIASA), read 144+ articles and wrote 9000+ lines of code.</description>

      <description>Pursuing a matrix form, seems I had missed some terms in the covariance equations Friday, which are suggested by the nice symmetry of this representation: (sometimes chalk and a camera are faster than tex).
This suggests the general form looks like
*dM* = *JM* + (*J*M)^T^ + g
Where M is the covariance matrix and J the Jacobian of f as before. dM is the matrix of derivative terms, though clearly not a rigorous notation.</description>

Starting with a simple test case of a modified Crowley model:   Model is implemented on a branch of the warningSignals package. Model in crowley.c, Depends on modified gillespie.c library in this package. Branching necessary as implementation simplifies the gillespie function dependencies, but these changes would break compatibility with warning_signals.</description>

      <description>Summary  Have a functional likelihood calculation from the full individual-based simulation, see Friday. Accuracy needs more testing, and the computation is probably too slow for optimization routines. Have an implementation of the linear decrease in stability model with analytic conditional probability density. Needed a couple adjustments today. Need to add direct simulation to the warning signals package, currently retunrs only time-averaged/ensemble averaged stats. Can be approximated by setting the window equal to the timestep and ensembles equal to one.</description>

      <description>Most papers do not give a statistical approach, but merely argue for the existence of a trend. Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau approach proved very unreliable. While the preliminary de-trending approach is unjustified in that the simulated data is known to be absent from trends, as a kind of windowed averaging it may sense as a way to detect changes. Should distinguish between the gradual slow changes and change-point estimation. Perhaps change-point provides a more rigorous starting point.</description>

False warning signals remain just as common when signals are averaged across 100 replicates?
 Exploring statistical qualification of early warning signals. Dakos et. al. (2008) use a correlation significance test (based on Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau) on the autocorrelation to detect the warning signals. Correlation significance test seems a very poor estimate of signal, high false positive rate at any threshold p-value for sufficiently frequent sampling.</description>

      <description>Basically I want to apply central limit theorem for stationary processes (accounts for covariances), assuming mean zero  where
 Discussion of Freidlin-Wentzell theory in connection to Arrhenius law and the well-defined stochastic tipping point which occurs before the branch point. Kurtz results don&amp;rsquo;t really help in the case of ergodicity, can make statements about the (even non-stationary) ensemble limit.</description>

      <description>svn revision 27 should have functional parallel code! Certainly I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten much better at openmp in the past few days. Difficult to maintain a general API that is agnostic to the model details and still knows enough about the data formats to declare them appropriately for each thread. My lesson for my future coding: by writing with parallelization concepts in mind from the start I should be able to significantly reduce the overhead time when I go back and add openmp directives.</description>

      <description>A solution!  After a good bit more exploring permutations of openmp commands and experimenting with code (should have been done in a branch version so would be in the version management, instead done in my local experimental sandbox so will have to implement and merge into real code still!) was able to understand the root of my problem and pose a coherent question. Posting that question on stack overflow solved my problem in under an hour.</description>

      <description>Not much chance for progress.
 11-noon (I was interviewed by Science Careers reporter). noon-1 Lunch w/ John Huelsenbeck. Good perspective on having formula representation of models rather than on/off switch for parameters! Will have to implement eventually in the phylogenetics project. 1-1:30 Wainwrighters lunch meeting. 1:30-3:30 prep Monte Carlo for teaching non-majors evolution course &amp;ndash; case study on mimicry and levels of selection. Presenting Monday, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes in [User:Carl_Boettiger/Notebook/Teaching] 4-6 Phylogenetics discussion group (followed by CPB happy hour = more phylogenetics discussion).</description>

      <title>The Ergodicity Question- Time averaging vs Ensemble averaging</title>

      <description>11am &amp;ndash; 3pm
 Tried time averaging over the entire time window (set sample_size to 1 less than max time); in close agreement with the ensemble predictions (getting around 1355). Mystery doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually be a problem in the method, but just innate variability! Even over reasonable time-averages and ensemble averages there&amp;rsquo;s significant deviation from the expected variance! This variation around the warning signal/leading indicator is exactly what might frustrate the warning signal.</description>

      <description>Goal for today: implement analytic calculations for warning signals.
 10am-12pm  Abstraction/functionalizing code.
 4pm-7pm  Implement GSL ode solvers for linear noise approximation:
Recall our dynamics are d(n) = *e*n + a
and defining the jump moments (van Kampen) α~1~(n) = b(n) − d(n)
α~2~(n) = b(n) + d(n)

recall that we have a linear Fokker-Planck equation whose solution is Gaussian and specified by the first two moments:  These are implemented in code using GSL ode library.</description>

      <description>Just committed changes to the google project. warning_signals.c now provides a fully functional, ensemble enabled simulation written with functional API for general Gillespie simulations (at last! I&amp;rsquo;ve come quite a way in my C coding from those early Gillespie simulations for adaptive dynamics two years ago). Still need to pull the API out of the single file. Doxygen-compatible literate programming included, but needs significant expansion before it can really be used effectively as an API for other users.</description>

      <description>Meeting with Dr. Alan Hastings soon to discuss progress on this project. We&amp;rsquo;ll also see what he thinks of the open lab notebook. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot I want to cover in this meeting.  Warning Signals  Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m leading a discussion in seminar on regime shift literature, so I need to review major ideas of the paper with Alan. Particularly need to be clear on the role of dimensionality and if/when the population dynamics lack an appropriate Hamiltonian and whether that&amp;rsquo;s an important part of the argument.</description>

      <description>(Originally posted on OpenWetWare)
 This is the first entry in my lab notebook, but not the beginning of the project. I have been exploring demographic and colored environmental noise since beginning my graduate program at UC Davis. Much of that time has been spent in building the appropriate tool set though, so now it&amp;rsquo;s time to dive in.
 A good starting point is Denis et. al. (2001) Ecological Monographs 71.</description>
