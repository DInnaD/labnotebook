      <description>Markdown over latex? knitr may have solved the fundamental challenge of all Sweave/latex users with Markdown. Too many of us must be able to work with collaborators who don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX and journals that won&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX. It&amp;rsquo;s a sad state of the affairs, and has improved slowly for journals (at least many will take pdfs for initial submissions) if not for collaborators. Consequently getting away from LaTeX would be nice, but Word or Google docs just won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>

      <description>Greatly enjoyed seeing this perspective on power laws (Stumpf &amp;amp; Porter, 2012) Or as Richard McElreath put even more concisely,
 People get amazed by power laws but never by normal distributions. Seems like some max ent outcomes astonish while others don&amp;rsquo;t. When so many mechanisms aggregate to common densities, I&amp;rsquo;d hope we&amp;rsquo;d stop trying to argue that we can go backwards from pattern to process so easily.

      <description>My treebase package is now up on the CRAN repository. (Source code is up, the binaries should appear soon). Here&amp;rsquo;s a few introductory examples to illustrate some of the functionality of the package. Thanks in part to new data deposition requirements at journals such as Evolution, Am Nat, and Sys Bio, and data management plan requirements from NSF, I hope the package will become increasingly useful for teaching by replicating results and for meta-analyses that can be automatically updated as the repository grows.</description>

      <description>I have updated the package to 0.0-3 alpha, having all the target functionality now. Improved error handling, downloading of data, processing. Get the source or windows binary here. I now download the full database and cache it locally for faster querying. Just about any kind of manipulation is then possible and fast.
For instance, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick demo based on a question from Peter Wainwright: &amp;ldquo;are there more gobys or labrids on reefs?</description>

In lab known for its quality data collection, high-speed video style, writing the weekly blog post can be a bit of a challenge for the local code monkey. That&amp;rsquo;s right, no videos today. But lucky for me, even this group can still make good use of publicly available data.</description>

XML Notes Had to identify blocks by a child node that specifies the identity, and then find the sibling node that contains the content I needed. Goes something like this:

      <description>Duncan Meeting  ROAuth/RCurl question. Mendeley is OAuth 1, github is OAuth 2 (simpler). Both are implemented in pure R in another package, may be good. OAuth 1 constructs complicated http urls with secret, and token, and random key, need to escape chars, etc. OAuth 2 is https, just uses token. Authentication options: Jeff&amp;rsquo;s ROAuth/Duncan&amp;rsquo;s mod, other OAuth package. RMendeley&amp;ndash; windows binary, competition? socialR &amp;ndash; discussed strategy to get a figure with matching code and data.</description>

      <description>Reading  International Symposium on Biomathematics and Ecology: Education and Research &amp;ndash; This looks excellent, wonder if I can make it. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s in Portland and the acronym is promising. Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab - Based in Berkeley, looks rather intriguing, hard to tell how active this is as a group. Ecoinformatics? So it does exist? Paraphrasing Jeremy Fox, has it done anything? A rather nice review in ARES: (Jones et.</description>

      <title>TreeBASE in R: a first tutorial</title>

      <description>My TreeBASE R package is essentially functional now. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick tutorial on the kinds of things it can do. Grab the treebase package here, install and load the library into R.
TreeBASE provides two APIs to query the database, one which searches by the metadata associated with different publications (called OAI-PMH), and another which queries the phylogenies directly (called Phylo-ws). They have somewhat redundant functions, but for our purposes the second one returns the actual data, while the first returns metadata.</description>

      <description>TREEBASE PACKAGE:
 Modified treebase package to return the treebase id in the phylo class as phy$id, so that I can use the id to query the appropriate meta data.
 Modified the package with the option to return only max number of trees,
try(xpathApply(search_returns, paste(&amp;quot;//rdf:li[position()&amp;lt; &amp;quot;, max_trees, &amp;quot;]&amp;quot;, sep=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;), function(x){  &amp;hellip;
 Modified to check for branch lengths and remove trees without branch lengths from the returned set.</description>

      <description>Next Steps Treebase  (See Sunday&amp;rsquo;s post) - Phylo-ws implemented, but a few extra functions would strengthen the interface a bit: limit the number of trees returned, querying trees for branch lengths,
 RaXML pipeline for returning rough branch lengths conditioned on the given topology, user documentation, more test examples.
 Implement OAI-PMH test cases for treebase: For instance, query all records after a given date (or all possible other queries), i.</description>

      <title>Sunday: a few Treebase R package updates</title>

      <description>Working on a few updates to the TreeBASE package. This flushes out the basic functionality provided by the phylo-ws API now. Needs a bit more testing of the possible queries and some bells and whistles options. Meanwhile, going to start looking at the metadata side with the OAI-PMH API. With this I should be able to grab metadata associated with a tree or the tree associated with the metadata. Should also be able to extend the queries over to other databases such as Dryad.</description>

      <description>Lightning Talk Proposal  I will present the R package treeBASE, which provides an R implementation of the treeBASE phylows API. This package makes it possible to search and import data from this database of published phylogenetic trees easily from within an R script. Recent data archiving requirements at major evolutionary journals such as The American Naturalist (Whitlock et. al. 2010) and Evolution (Fairbairn, 2011) to deposit data used in the study on the Dryad digital repository (and deposit accompanying trees in TreeBASE), along with new requirements for data management from funderssuch as NSF are rapidly changing the landscape of data availability.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently ((25 April, 8 April)) begun a project to see if I can search for and load phylogenies from TreeBASE directly into R. Thanks to the rather brilliant API in place (documented on the treeBASE wiki) for TreeBASE, some advice from Rutger Vos (TreeBASE developer), and some xpaths R code from Gabe Becker (stats grad student, UC Davis), I have a (mostly) working demonstration. As I get a chance, I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding the rest of the queries available in the API, improve the error handling and give some more thought to a user interface.</description>

      <description>Reading  GrrlScientist disagrees with M. Nielsen (and I add my 2c: Open Science might not give you the credit you need to get a job in today&amp;rsquo;s science culture, but hey, in all probability, neither will the traditional strategy, so have fun). Nature says: Too many PhDs Some useful tools for data visualization: particularly want to try:Fusion Tables, Gephi, DataViz Mendeley groups don&amp;rsquo;t display (or share) stars. Can only sort A-Z or by most recent.</description>

      <description>Taking a look at the TreeBase database for potential project with Gabe &amp;amp; Duncan&amp;rsquo;s Large Data seminar. It would be interesting to get a working knowledge of the database and the API, making large-scale meta-analyses easy. Many studies seem to select taxa based on what they have in their own lab rather than re-use existing phylogenies, not because it is better suited to answering the questions but because it is more familiar.</description>

      <description>Partially Observable Stochastic Processes (cont.)  Reading a bit more about pomp. Looks like SCM and PMCMC offer nicely Bayesian inference tools using the same framework (rprocess and dmeasure), making a nice platform for implementing multiple methods. Almost feels like having the likelihood equation in hand again. A bit more skeptical about nonlinear forecasting and probe matching, as they feel even more heuristic or arbitrary. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s just the price of having only rmeasure instead of dmeasure available though.</description>
