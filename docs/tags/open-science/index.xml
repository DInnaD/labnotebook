      <title>Deep challenges to dynamic documentation in daily workflows</title>

      <description>We often discuss dynamic documents such as Sweave and knitr in reference to final products such as publications or software package vignettes. In this case, all the elements involved are already fixed: external functions, code, text, and so forth. The dynamic documentation engine is really just a tool to combine them (knit them together). Using dynamic documentation on a day-to-day basis on ongoing research presents a compelling opportunity but a rather more complex challenge as well.</description>

      <description>ugh, most journals don&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold to their own data publication policies.
PNAS theoretically endorses UPSIDE, r citet(&amp;quot;10.1073/pnas.0400437101&amp;quot;) principles from the National Academy of Science:
 Principle 1. Authors should include in their publications the data, algorithms, or other information that is central or integral to the publicationâ€”that is, whatever is necessary to support the major claims of the paper and would enable one skilled in the art to verify or replicate the claims.</description>

      <description>Near the end of another excellent day of discussions we were asked to put pen to paper to outline our own views in writing. My own contribution was the following notebook scribble.
My own vision of what ISEES should be doing for workforce development:
ISEES would employ a multi-scale approach to improve basic computational expertise across the entire workforce necessary to fully participate in the modern software-immersed world of research through the development of training standards, while using a working-group model focused on emerging researcher-developer communities which would simultaneously improve the quality and synthesis of existing software tools while also delivering essential skills to the most transformative members of the research software communities.</description>

      <description>Education / Workforce Development Group Cannot do grand synthesis opaquely and be science. must be able to scale and evolve.
How did data succeed? What features really made the difference and what were just sideshows?
 Sticks (Funder and journal mandates?) Working groups (NCEAS) Training external forces: there is more data.
  Why one center? Why not 15 centers? Divided by discipline rather than region&amp;hellip;. synthesize the synthesis centers</description>

      <description>Writing out some advice for our GSOC student on XML parsing. (Now filed as RNeXML/#11
Here is some quick background on different ways we might go about extracting NeXML into an R object we want to work with. We can use S4 classes, R&amp;rsquo;s native data.frame and list types, or extract specific terms of interest with xpath. I illustrate each of these below using the example &amp;ldquo;trees.xml&amp;rdquo; in your repository.</description>

      <description>Prosecutor  Add figures for both examples with and without ASS text to accomidate both examples ROC curves? proof-reading  ews-review  looking over revisions, touch-ups See issues log for details  Links  Impressive set of tools provided by the Whitehouse open data project In particular, see the tool for generating a RESTful API from CSV files and the &amp;ldquo;common core&amp;rdquo; metadata definitions. Notebook complies with many of these (throught the Dublin core RDFa), but looks like I could benefit from adding some more terms from the Data Catalog Vocabulary.</description>

      <description>At home after birth of Edward since Jan 19th, leaving little time for research. Assembled notes from a few side projects I&amp;rsquo;ve moved forward in the wee hours. Covers the past several days.
XML and RDFa parsing I have been using the lab notebook to explore technology for scientific communication, including making use of semantic and linked data concepts. To illustrate some of the potential these tools can offer I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a short post with examples parsing and exploring the XML and RDFa data in the notebook.</description>

      <description>Earlier today, Scott Collins, the president of the Ecological Society of America has announced that the society will now accept articles that have previously been posted on preprint servers. This comes on the heels of a growing discussion in our community. Ethan White has a good summary over on Jabberwocky Ecology.
Many voices have joined the discussion over the past month, and it is exciting and vindicating to see the Society engage and discuss these questions.</description>

      <description>What would a semantic lab notebook look like?Â What would be possible with such a structure, ideally?Â What is already possible now?Â There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that can be done with an electronic notebook that adds value over a paper notebook: browsing by categories and tags, embedding links, time-stamping entries, searching the full text, and having automated trackbacks or pingbacks when a post is mentioned in another post or appears elsewhere on the web.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of rapid development in scientific tools based on a Wordpress platform recently, perhaps spurred in part by the recent Beyond-the-PDF and sessions in Science Online conferences.Â A new discussion group has emerged around these tools, as described by Martin Fenner.
I have been exploring better tools for citation management within my lab notebook. Recently I have been using the papercite plugin to add citations from my BibTeX files, which are generated from Mendeley, as I described earlier.</description>

      <description>Automated scripts for image uploads. Tag-based generation of a slideshow:


Running the script:
 ./flickr_slideshow *.png  Creates the html code that can be embedded into the notebook for a slideshow those images. Images only get the date-time tag as a unique id.


This one uses the mediawiki plugin. More formatting options could be incorporated of course. (Creates the thumbnail images down the right-hand side).</description>

      <description>Simulation Results (code)  Analytics (Analytics code)
Notebooks and files Looking at a better way to get figures into my online notebook. I often run simulations that generate figures which I look at, make some adjustments to the code based on the figure, and then delete or overwrite the figure without uploading it to my notebook, because it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; and uploading takes a lot of clicks, particularly when the code generates 36 figures in a run.</description>

      <description>Public code hosting  Project code now available through Github. Advantages to public hosting: Replication of adaptive dynamics simulations can be difficult, particularly in matching various nuisance parameters. While there is certainly much pedagogical value in individual researchers implementing their own simulations, verification and reproducibility of scientific results would be greatly facilitated by adapting an accepted open source code base and adding branches, etc. Researchers could much more immediately benefit from the work of their colleagues and spend more time implementing novel research and less reproducing it.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up paper on waiting time to branching in adaptive dynamics. Cleaning up code from summer. Now in a local git repository in adaptiveDynamics/code Moved ensemble parallelization to higher level, so parallelization can be performed in R or C. Adding documentation  Current status  Calculates the waiting time to complete phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 successfully from individual-based simulation.  Phase 1 ~ Completed when 2 branches exist over threshold Phase 2 ~ Completed when a third population has established over threshold exterior to a stable pair Phase 3 ~ Completed when two populations over threshold are separated in traitspace by more than finishline units</description>

      <description>Research  Wrote summary function using bootstrap confidence intervals for the bootstraps of the likelihoods directly. On interpreting the bootstraps of likelihoods directly:   The extent to which the distributions themselves are distinct provides an indication of the ability to distinguish between models on the given phylogenetic tree and the actual data. For instance, if the tree was a star tree and the data produced by either BM or OU1, then all distributions would fall on top of one another.</description>

 Will work on acceleration of code (avoiding refitting), meanwhile a little more trouble shooting and queuing some long runs.
 ace function fails on certain data sets for unknown reasons. Think rewriting this from scratch will be an important step.
