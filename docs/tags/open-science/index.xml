      <description>Research  Wrote summary function using bootstrap confidence intervals for the bootstraps of the likelihoods directly. On interpreting the bootstraps of likelihoods directly:   The extent to which the distributions themselves are distinct provides an indication of the ability to distinguish between models on the given phylogenetic tree and the actual data. For instance, if the tree was a star tree and the data produced by either BM or OU1, then all distributions would fall on top of one another.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up paper on waiting time to branching in adaptive dynamics. Cleaning up code from summer. Now in a local git repository in adaptiveDynamics/code Moved ensemble parallelization to higher level, so parallelization can be performed in R or C. Adding documentation  Current status  Calculates the waiting time to complete phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 successfully from individual-based simulation.  Phase 1 ~ Completed when 2 branches exist over threshold Phase 2 ~ Completed when a third population has established over threshold exterior to a stable pair Phase 3 ~ Completed when two populations over threshold are separated in traitspace by more than finishline units</description>

      <description>Public code hosting  Project code now available through Github. Advantages to public hosting: Replication of adaptive dynamics simulations can be difficult, particularly in matching various nuisance parameters. While there is certainly much pedagogical value in individual researchers implementing their own simulations, verification and reproducibility of scientific results would be greatly facilitated by adapting an accepted open source code base and adding branches, etc. Researchers could much more immediately benefit from the work of their colleagues and spend more time implementing novel research and less reproducing it.</description>

      <description>Simulation Results (code)  Analytics (Analytics code)
Notebooks and files Looking at a better way to get figures into my online notebook. I often run simulations that generate figures which I look at, make some adjustments to the code based on the figure, and then delete or overwrite the figure without uploading it to my notebook, because it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; and uploading takes a lot of clicks, particularly when the code generates 36 figures in a run.</description>

      <description>Automated scripts for image uploads. Tag-based generation of a slideshow:


Running the script:
 ./flickr_slideshow *.png  Creates the html code that can be embedded into the notebook for a slideshow those images. Images only get the date-time tag as a unique id.


This one uses the mediawiki plugin. More formatting options could be incorporated of course. (Creates the thumbnail images down the right-hand side).</description>

      <description>Seem to have successfully fixed the behavior when getting over parameterized models. See diffs against the git log for details.
 Will work on acceleration of code (avoiding refitting), meanwhile a little more trouble shooting and queuing some long runs.
 ace function fails on certain data sets for unknown reasons. Think rewriting this from scratch will be an important step.
  Mixture Models in Bayesian context  Josh sent me this paper regarding our discussion on model choice in Bayesian context last Friday.</description>
