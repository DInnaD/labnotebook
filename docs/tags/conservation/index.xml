      <description>Just because I&amp;rsquo;m a theorist deeply entrenched in methodological concerns about uncertainty and decision making doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t think about practical conservation from time to time. Some musings from my comment here, copied over for my own reference.
Though I would like to believe the gap stems from the problems you discuss, I think that differing objectives between research and application may play a much larger role. I suspect that scientific papers that are most useful and influential for conservation practitioners and policymakers are those which confirm what they already believe, or whatever the interests opposed to them least want to hear.</description>
