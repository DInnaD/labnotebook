      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a table of all the comparisons, indicating which is the preferred model in each pairwise comparison. (In my outline, Figure 4 shows the bm3 v a3 for KT and open lever ratio, and Fig 3 shows the actual parameter values for those models). This table is all for the case that allows shifts at both pharyngeal and the intramandibular transitions. I have graphs of the actual parameter values as well (which we need to see if the constraint has increased or decreased at the transition, and by how much), but gets complex quickly.</description>

Figures show strong evidence for the relax of constraint hypothesis, as the strength of selection (alpha parameters) appears to have substantially weakened in both morphological traits in the parrotfish clade relative to the wrasses clade. The wrasses show strong preference for OU model with substantial stabilizing selection, while the Parrotfish estimate almost zero stabilizing selection (Brownian model, clear phylogenetic signal).</description>

      <description>Research  Wrote summary function using bootstrap confidence intervals for the bootstraps of the likelihoods directly. On interpreting the bootstraps of likelihoods directly:   The extent to which the distributions themselves are distinct provides an indication of the ability to distinguish between models on the given phylogenetic tree and the actual data. For instance, if the tree was a star tree and the data produced by either BM or OU1, then all distributions would fall on top of one another.</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping procedures should have the option to refit the painting. Currently use the fixed painting but refit parameters. wrote the function peaks_update() which update the painting as well as the OU peak parameters.  20 replicates, bootstraps the painting step as well
Computing / Package  LR_bootstrap and model_bootstrap should be the same function call with an optional second model for the LR bootstrapping. Similarly the LR_bootstrap_all and model_bootstrap_all() should be the same function call.</description>

      <description>Graham &amp;amp; Peter Meeting Fig 1
Fig 2
 Decided that bootstrapping against fixed model parameters would be more difficult to interpret, Fig 1. Simulated data results with refitting seem strange (Fig. 2), perhaps related to fitting of the tree. Observed LR for data should at least remain symmetric, so something has gone wrong. Expected pattern should be deducible simply by upper left triangle of graphs, should accept the first model where the data becomes typical.</description>

      <description>Current Situation &amp;amp; Challenges 2000 bootstraps of models fitted to simulated ou2 data
 A single data set is produced by simulation under a specified ou2 model on the Labrid tree (actually one that was fitted to the original Labrid data). Each model (Brownian motion and 1 to 5 separate OU peaks (assigned by my partition function) is fitted to this dataset. Each fitted model is used to generate 2000 replicate datasets For each replicate dataset, the model used to generate it is compared to each other model in likelihood ratio test 2(log(L~1~) âˆ’ log(L~2~)), where L~1~ is the likelihood of the model that generated the data.</description>

      <description>Parallelized LR_bootstrap_all() and model_bootstrap_all() bootstrapping functions. Lets the bootstrapping of different models (or LRs between models) to be performed on different machines. Using the snowfall package in R for easy parallel computing. The parallel loop is done through the sfLapply() function. Had to get libraries and functions exported to all loops using sfLibrary() and sfExportAll(). R-sig-hpc mailing list was very helpful at getting this up and running at 4am.</description>

      <description>Maximum likelihood assignment based on arbitrary number of partitions now completed. Working on stochastic assignment. Now have functions for:   partitioning data into k groups, inferring an ancestral state painting based on this partition inferring a continuous model with k OU regimes based on this painting   need to add my function for the proper model-comparison bootstrap of likelihood ratio values rather than the likelihoods themselves. See my original entry on this approach.</description>

      <description>Exploring parallel computing options. OpenMP for distributed memory applications. learning git &amp;ndash; need to get used to the branch and merge, install on one.  Research The failure of the Anoles data set to robustly select the more common model can easily be explained by the likelihood distribution: Not surprising since this dataset consists of only 23 taxa. The Labrid tree of 114 taxa clearly resolves the difference between the different models.</description>

      <description>Final day of Bodega Phylogenetics workshop: a full day of student presentations. (High resolution images for the trees available by clicking on them)
Principle figures from my investigation of the Labrid data. While morphospace doesn&amp;rsquo;t present an obvious clustering, it can be effectively divided by my maximum likelihood partitioning scheme on fin angle. A smoothed density plot of fin angle alone reveals two identifiable modes in the traitspace.
Based on the discretized partition, ancestral states are reconstructed under both the equal rates and independent rates model.</description>
