      <description>rfishbase updated to Duncan&amp;rsquo;s feedback writing intro section on Prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s Fallacy. wrightscape update project repository. Scripts mostly in demos, results in notebook. Notebook makes is easy to get the most recent writeup on the topic, from where I can start to track back the history, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a good at-a-glance view of the analyses I&amp;rsquo;ve run side-by-side. Moving the R script demos/ into markdown knitted files in inst/examples/ and rerunning.</description>

      <description>Markdown over latex? knitr may have solved the fundamental challenge of all Sweave/latex users with Markdown. Too many of us must be able to work with collaborators who don&amp;rsquo;t know LaTeX and journals that won&amp;rsquo;t accept LaTeX. It&amp;rsquo;s a sad state of the affairs, and has improved slowly for journals (at least many will take pdfs for initial submissions) if not for collaborators. Consequently getting away from LaTeX would be nice, but Word or Google docs just won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>
