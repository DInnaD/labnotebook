      <description>Talking points for phone interview with Lucy
Finding warning signals in the wild
 Gold standard &amp;ndash; experimental group, control group Real world: We have no control group.
  Would we know a warning signal when we saw it?
From statistics to models: We fit a generalized models of the processes that are and aren&amp;rsquo;t approaching a tipping point, and compare the models. The modeling approach is also more sensitive than the simple statistics.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve simulated 1000 replicates of a system that has alternative stable states, but is not approaching the bifurcation. I&amp;rsquo;ve added enough noise (demographic stochasticity in this case, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what) that 129&amp;frasl;1000 transition stochastically to the bad state, so I have decent sample sizes in each. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m finding: If I condition on having crashed (i.e. take the 129 that transition) and apply our model-based early warning signal, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t detect any early warning sign.</description>

      <description>Going through additional examples of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to see / demonstrate but do not fit into the narrative of the manuscript. Writing these in knitr/dynamic documentation to confirm code produces the examples listed, and give a bit tighter integration between text and code examples.
Show the parameter distributions: We can also look at the bootstraps of the parameters. Another helper function will reformat this data from reps list. The fit column uses a two-letter code to indicate first what model was used to simulate the data, and then what model was fit to the data.</description>

      <description>Greatly enjoyed seeing this perspective on power laws (Stumpf &amp;amp; Porter, 2012) Or as Richard McElreath put even more concisely,
 People get amazed by power laws but never by normal distributions. Seems like some max ent outcomes astonish while others don&amp;rsquo;t. When so many mechanisms aggregate to common densities, I&amp;rsquo;d hope we&amp;rsquo;d stop trying to argue that we can go backwards from pattern to process so easily.

      <description>Abstract The recogÂ­niÂ­tion that ecosysÂ­tems can undergo sudÂ­den shifts to alterÂ­nate, less desirÂ­able staÂ­ble states has led to the desire to idenÂ­tify early warnÂ­ing signs of these impendÂ­ing colÂ­lapses. Motivated by the mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­ics of bifurÂ­caÂ­tions, the search for early warnÂ­ing signs seeks to detect subtle patterns that may precede these shift. Faced with limited and imperfect data, such forecasting is fraught with uncertainty. I will present work illustrating how we can quantify the risks of false alarms and missed detection of these early warning signals, and illustrate how this information can be used to inform robust decision-making that may avoid collapse.</description>

      <description>The optimal policy with symmetric L1 costs to changing the quotas results in the solutions that stop changing, sometimes at no harvest (if there&amp;rsquo;s scrap value), or at some fixed high harvest if no scrap value. (See earlier notes). Asymmetric costs of comparable magnitude result in more crashes.
When we apply an L1 norm cost of the same magnitude as before for decreasing quotas, but allow increasing quotas to be free (no cost to environmental lobby), the solution follows the Reed optimum is in purple (harvest_alt) (cost-free adjustment), while the blue is the harvest level being implemented with a cost:</description>

      <description>pdg-control  plots for changing costs Report out to Training Problem II group.  ggplot note defining functions that return a ggplot object can be tricky. If you compute some objects in the plot function (stats etc), those stats are not stored by the object (due to lazy evaluation, usually a very nice time-saving feature), so the plot cannot be produced unless the function returns those things to the global environment (or from wherever the plot will be printed/evaluated).</description>

Sebastian mentioned his advisor&amp;rsquo;s work oninverting the sphere without creating a fold, including a proof through a series of physical models made with chickenwire.Â Math is crazy.

      <description>Modeling choices Allee effect model: Myers Beverton-Holt with harvesting-effort mortality:
$$ x_{t+1} = f(x) = \frac{a x_t^{\alpha}}{1+ x_t^{\alpha}/b} - e x $$ For $ \alpha = 2 $, equilibrium points are $ x = 0 $ and
$$ x = \frac{ab}{2(1+e)} \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left(\frac{ab}{1+e}\right)^2-4b } $$
As written this differs from our earlier solutions a couple respects &amp;ndash; the growth function applies to the unharvested population, which then experiences harvesting mortality, and the control variable is fishing effort, not harvest.</description>

      <description>Dakos (Dakos et. al. 2012) considers $ \tfrac{dx}{dt} = f(x,p) $ and perturbs the parameter randomly to introduce variation. Evaluating around an equilibrium where $ f(x^, p^) = 0 $, they expand to first order (citing (Ripa &amp;amp; Heino, 1999)):
$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \partial_x f(x^,p^)(x-x^) + \partial_p f(x^,p^) (p - p^) $$
and taking $ \xi = x- x^* $, with some slight of hand argue this can be rewritten as an Ito process,</description>

      <description>Discrete-time state equation Discrete-time solution appears to be all about dynamic programming
and a chance for me to remember that I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice writing recursive functions. It&amp;rsquo;s just that in thinking about the problem, you start from the end, with the trivial subcase, and keep adding the layers. But the recursive function kinda starts at the beginning, and that trivial case is the exit condition. R doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very efficient with these recursive functions, so this might become a C sub-routine eventually.</description>

      <description>Optimal control Imagine we&amp;rsquo;re trying to minimize $J = \theta( y(t_F), t_F)$
subject to both the state equations: $\dot y = f(y(t), u(t))$, Note these are continuous, applying at all times $t$.
and boundary conditions: $\psi(y(t_F), u(t_F), t_F) = 0$. These are discrete, applying only at fixed time $t_F $. We have to put the continuous constraint in as an integral:
$$ \hat J = \left[\phi + \mathbf{\nu}^T \psi \right]_{tF} - \int{t_I}^{t_F} \mathbf{\lambda}^T \left(\dot{\mathbf{y}} - f(\mathbf{y}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)) \right) dt $$</description>

      <description>Very interesting article on tipping points that seems to answer a question I put to Vasilis back in 2009 at IIASA: whether critical transitions due to bifurcations could be distinguished from stochastic transitions due to rare events Ditlevsen &amp;amp; Johnsen, 2010. Argues that some of the well-known climate transitions may have been stochastic transitions instead. Will need a closer read to better assess how they are distinguishing between such transitions in the data.</description>

      <description>What you want to look for are stock assessments. For example, for the species closest to home, under the Pacific Fisheries Management Council:
http://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/archived-stock-assessments/
Three rockfish species that might be good to look into for your purposes are widow, yelloweye, and bocaccio, but these will have shorter-term data than any of the cod data. Also, NOAA NMFS Technical Reports on individual stocks often have long appendices with lots of data.</description>

      <description>Marissa mentioned looking into some of the fisheries data for early warning signals: particularly the Canadian Cod collapse.
Apparently several of the data sets areÂ problematic. All deal with catch instead of abundance and measurement error is highly significant, though it seems that some may suffer from more troublesome systematic errors. Taking a quick look over what is available. Lots of data, but despite what appears to be some rather sophisticated tools available on the sites, I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of difficulty finding just what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the model choice/model adequacy section of the appendix. This is the section that Reviewer 2 said needed further development, which would be beyond the scope of this paper:
 Here the authors claim that by using particular structural models based on assumptions about underlying dynamics their method makes it easy to identify cases that do not conform to the assumptions. It would be interesting to evaluate this claim but it would require a substantial amount of analysis that may be beyond the scope of a short paper.</description>

      <description>Working on ESA presentation. See slides and code for details.
 Adding movie a time series which gets longer (and closer to collapse) each frame, with corresponding warning signals for the interval thus far shown below (for CV and autocorrelation). Include sparsely sampled (100) and densely sampled (1000) examples. Compare always using a sliding window-size equal to half the length of the available data (works well on longer time series) to a fixed-width sliding window (doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well ever).</description>

      <description>The Gillespie algorithm has two parts: (1) determine what event happens, (2) determine when it happens. Consider the system of equations $$ \dot X_i = f_i(\vec X) $$
where the $f_i$ give the rates of creation and annihilation (negative and postive parts of $f_i(\vec X)$ must be listed seperately) for all species $x_i$. We assume this gives the mean rate at which each event occurs, drawn from on exponential distribution. We could simply draw the associated random exponential time for each reaction, and pick the minimum for which event occurs.</description>

      <description>oikos post launch case of increased sampling on sim data for autocorrelation (is our approach more robust to model differences?)  IBM data Example Using data from the individual-based model simulation of a system approaching a saddle-node.
Variance While the initial example with variance shows almost no signal, increasing the sampling effort substantially improves the performance. This can be seen in the ROC curves and as a tightening and spreading out of the null and test distributions as the sampling effort is increased.</description>

      <description>Looking at ways to visually explain receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Should probably be done in a way that maps the curves to the points along the curve. May make a nice graphic but perhaps unnecessary.
Perhaps simpler to present as single panel Integrating the test distribution to the left instead of the right gives the error rate (Type I/Type II errors, False Alarms/Missed Events):

      <description>In preparing manuscript on warning signals, reviewing the literature on when statistical validation of the warning signal is included, and if so, what kind are done. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly no consensus in the approach, with the majority of papers not even attempting a method (and those that do not finding significance). Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s key review (Scheffer et. al. 2009) calls for the need to measure statistical significance of warning signals,
 Therefore, it would be useful to build a set of reliable statistical procedures to test whether an increase in autocorrelation, for example, is significant.</description>

      <description>Warning signals package  Reviewing Numerical challenges for faster analysis on warningsignals
 created a quick mcmcTools package so different packages can use my custom routines.Â Will have to explore some of the standard packages eventually, though most seem somewhat specialized (the Bayesian task-view is epic).Â bayesm looks promising, and LearnBayes package that accompanies Jim Albert&amp;rsquo;s book (Albert, unknown) might be worth a closer look.

  Seminar on Species trees Coop/Moore Seminar on *BEASTÂ (Heled &amp;amp; Drummond, 2009) andÂ BEST (Liu et. al. 2008).
Essential differences: BEST uses Mr. Bayes to compute probabilities over gene trees (over uniform prior).Â Then estimates the species tree by importance sampling from this distribution to reflect constraints under a convergence model.Â Integrates over effective population sizes rather than estimating (highly uncertain anyway), requires rooting, and a rather fast/loose implementation of ultra-metricizing trees.</description>

      <description>Alan and I have been considering analyzing a particular system for early warning signals where we could highlight risk management from an economics stand-point, probably with the help of Jim Sanchirico.Â Our current work focuses on quantifying the relative risk of false alarms and missed detections.Â While statisticians typically accept a 5% &amp;ldquo;false alarm&amp;rdquo; rate, we argue this given limited data this is always a trade-off against the missed detection rate and hence the location of this threshold should properly a decision of management, not of convention.</description>

      <description>Trying a different set-up for the graphs. Added two additional datasets, trying layout of making all three figures into a panels in a single figure.
Concerns:
 Better than only one empirical example, but not sure that the three Glaciation data sets add that much since they are all quite similar. Five panels wide might be too much. Don&amp;rsquo;t have an example where a transition is about to occur but the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t have adequate power even for our Likelihood method, third panel.</description>

      <description>[toc]
Refining examples  Updating finished runs to full formats
 Condensing/organizing code examples under the demos to follow the structure of the paper.
 Currently plotting code for manuscript loads a menagerie of different run results from different files. Would be better to consolidate by dataset.
  Proposed figure changes  Consider multiple empirical examples in main text
 Consider removing skew/kurtosis examples to the supplement?
 Consider other empirical examples</description>

      <description>Fixed bug causing montecarlotest() calls not to complete: in likelihood_bifurcation_models, LTC error checking uses any() to see if any Vx are negative, returns NA if none are negative but has NAs. rm.na=TRUE fixed this. GetParNames works, probably worth an appendix section to discuss parameter bootstraps as well, particularly in the cases of low power. Updated codes to turn this flag back on and am re-running. Figure3 plot has been using the 160 bootstrap replicates, updated to the 2000 replicates.</description>

      <description>Today mostly working over code sets for examples in appendix, and increasing replicates.Â Somehow more trouble than it should be, see commit history for today.
ibm_sim.R &amp;ndash; simulate from individual-based dynamics containing a saddle-node bifurcation (fully hysteresis model).
ibm_analysis.R &amp;ndash; run figure1, 2, 3 analysis (correlation test, bootstrap of test, likelihood test) on each data.
ibm_likelihood.R &amp;ndash; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be needed, all code is in deut_examples.R.Â Running now due to earlier parallel instance errors during montecarlotest.</description>

 Must figure out what data examples are going into the supplement.Â Most should be reasonably straight-forward to set up, may take a while to run.
 Have to figure out what to say about likelihood-based statistical method beyond definition of Cox&amp;rsquo;s delta,</description>

      <description>Read over Scheffer&amp;rsquo;s rather nice introduction(Scheffer, 2010) to the Drake paper(Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010).Â Last paragraph is particularly pertinenant:
 Clearly, we have just scratched the surface in exploring the possibilities and limitations of this emerging field. However, the prospect of identifying generic indicators is exciting, as the approach may provide an independent way to assess the risk of critical transitions. Expansion of our toolbox for prediction is especially welcome given the almost insurmountable problem of modelling complex systems in a quantitatively accurate way.</description>

      <description>Appendices Working on Appendices
Ergodicity Null of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau/rank correlations &amp;ndash; independence of X and Y, not satisfied even over replicates. Adjusted codes to use Pearson&amp;rsquo;s (default option, need to pass option up to higher-level functions). Repeated Figure 2 plots with Pearson&amp;rsquo;s, results not much different, funny multimodal though:
Actually verifying independence is rather more challenging, though convenient in this case that a test such as Pearson&amp;rsquo;s is not designed to do this, see http://en.</description>

      <description>Reading Some nice theoretical ecology papers out from our group recently, looking over today:
 Paul&amp;rsquo;s paper (Williams &amp;amp; Hastings, 2011) deals with some interesting work on persistence in complex models, (stochastic systems of mixture models), curious how it compares to the conclusions of (Schreiber, 2010).
 Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s paper (Schreiber et. al. 2011) with Dan Bolnick and Burger, another example of the importance of individual heterogeneity, this time in a nice phenotype/genotype specific way by combining quantitative genetics approaches with predator dynamics.</description>

      <description>Summary Paragraph
 Critical transitions exist (Holling, 1973), (May, 1977),(Scheffer et. al. 2001) Warning signals exist (Scheffer et. al. 2009), (Drake &amp;amp; Griffen, 2010) Warning signals are summary statistics, critical slowing down (Wissel, 1984). Statement of general problem: double-edged sword &amp;ndash; no quantification of the chance detection scheme will fail. We provide a way to do this We find existing methods lack sufficient power and have high false-alarm potential We provide a model-based solution using machinery of modern likelihood statistics  Background  Define CSD, standard detection scheme.</description>

      <description>Working on more examples for the notebook. Currently exploring a collection of simulated examples. In particular, would be useful to have simulated examples that look as realistic in data-density as possible (i.e. fewer sample points, also shorter sampling interval relative to timescale, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a fuzzy caterpillar. Second, would be good to include examples on data simulated from non-linearized systems made to represent some richer bifurcation examples. Finally it would be good to include as many real-data examples as reasonable.</description>

Should emphasize the countless and utterly arbitrary choices made in every one of these analyses. Should emphasize our approach can be applied without replicates. (also without interpolating/having evenly sampled data) Should do coefficient of variation on non-detrended data(?) should discuss?

      <description>Variance and warning signals Sebastian has several examples of dynamical systems that decrease in variance as they approach a bifurcation. In some sense this is not surprising, both are through the collapse of periodic attractors. Figure 2d in TPB paperSchreiber, 2003 has an example in a discrete system, and Figure 5a in the Ecology Letters paper (Schreiber &amp;amp; Rudolf, 2008) has a continuous-time example. Consider for instance the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, in which a stable limit cycle vanishes into an unstable node, as in a van der Pol oscillator,</description>

 Longer baseline run, nice 19, indicator_vs_likelihood.R 1600 reps, m=-0.015, N=500, T=100
 Longer sampling, same interval: nice 18, stronger_signal.R 160 reps m=-0.015, N = 2500, T=500
  Fails to compute, looks like poor estimates of model fits.

      <description>Added bar of observed tau on real data to the tau distributions. Fixed the tau-distribution method, running new data and real examples now.
Simulated data: can tell tau apart for instance, for autocorrelation (see photostream for variance, code hash for parameters, etc). While can&amp;rsquo;t really tell anything based on the tau on the autocorrelation for the Deuterium data for Glaciation III (which has just about the clearest signal of the deuterium set): Waiting to see how the likelihood statistics compare on these examples.</description>

      <description>Worried about accurate maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, as the optimization could still converge on values not far from the starting conditions (not as surprising as the starting parameters are estimated intelligently first from the summary statistics) but could also vary depending on initial conditions.
Second, while it requires some re-parameterization, the stationary model for both linearized transcritical (LTC) bifurcation model and the linearized saddle-node (LSN) model are identically Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models.</description>

      <description>Working on a little data exploration while writing up manuscript. I have been puzzled why it appears that most estimates of tau on the CaCO3 data infer negative correlation, as in
Despite the fact that there seems to be a loss of stability in the model:
require(warningsignals) load(&amp;quot;CaCO3.Rdat&amp;quot;) timedep$pars Ro m theta sigma 8.36841588 -0.03347119 -2.86194248 282.03234042  So m is negative, so that the system is loosing stability, but only very gradually.</description>

Greenhouse Earth, CaCO3 data:
Glaciation I-IV (deuterium data)
These use the unadjusted timeseries, and hence don&amp;rsquo;t reproduce the values of Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau statistic reported in (Dakos et. al. 2008).Â In fact they don&amp;rsquo;t even agree on the sign &amp;ndash; visually many of the datasets are certainly decreasing in variance. I ran the Monte-Carlo distributions forÂ tau on models estimated from these data-sets with and without warning, for variance (left) and autocorrelation (right), in the CaCO3 data:</description>

      <description>Continuing my tweaks to code to apply warning signals to the climate data used in (Dakos et. al. 2008).Â After adjusting my code to deal with variably spaced sampling intervals, I reread the supplement &amp;ndash; I had forgotten that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually consider data with variable time-scales, but instead interpolate the curves to have equally spaced sampling intervals.
Obviously this is not ideal.Â It is true that the autocorrelation would be impacted by non-equally spaced data, while there is no reason to do so for the variance indicator.</description>

Do we choose to present this as:

      <description>Morning has been rather difficult trying to get simulations up and running.Â Parallel library isn&amp;rsquo;t running on zero or one, variety of errors that seemed to be machine dependent and reminiscent of the ~./sfCluster problem, 3 hrs of debugging revealed this was indeed just a bug in my updated code.Â (In changing to my object-oriented simulate.gauss and update.gauss functions rather than calling the specific functions directly I hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated all the function calls).</description>

      <description>Going several directions at once in tweaking the warning signals code to make sure I have clear comparisons that are not resulting from any limitations in the numerical algorithms.Â Performing a variety of error checks, etc:
 Comparing fixed models vs comparing models estimated from the data
 Ensure that const model doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to estimate m (doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact likelihood anyway
 Ensure only positive values of sigma are returned (trying use trigger in setLTC and setLSN to return infinite variance if sigma is negative)</description>

Some difficulty in the &amp;ldquo;snowfall&amp;rdquo; parallel computation engine, removing the ~/.sfCluster directory seems to reset the error &amp;ldquo;unable to unserialize nodes&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Â Also don&amp;rsquo;t have good handling of variable names for tracking the boostrapping of parameters.Â For the moment have just added a toggle to suppress these to avoid dim mismatch in rownames command.Â Strange that this happens to the indicator_vs_likelihood code but not to the nearly-identical call to montecarlotest() in lin_bifur_models.</description>

      <description>Continuing writing and experimentation for examples in the warning signals manuscript, figuring out how to explain the need forÂ the likelihood-based model comparison approach rather than the standard method of summary statistics.
The traditional approach computes a particular &amp;ldquo;leading indicator&amp;rdquo;, such as variance or autocorrelation, in a sliding window along the time series. If the system is loosing stability approaching a bifurcation, it&amp;rsquo;s leading eigenvalue must go through zero and hence shows critical slowing down, with the associated pattern of increasing autocorrelation an increasing variance.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I derived the linearized SDEs for the saddle node bifurcation :
$$ dX = 2\sqrt{r(t)} (\sqrt{r(t)} + \theta -X) dt + \sigma \sqrt{\sqrt{r(t)}+\theta} dB_t $$
and the transcritical bifurcation
$$ dX = r(t) (K - X) dt + \sqrt{K} dB_t $$
Now to implement them for fitting by likelihood using generic $ r(t) $.Â I go back to the warning() model implemented in sde_likelihood.R code.Â We can just solve the odes directly:</description>

      <description>Have spent the last three days building and testing the infrastructure to fit the canonical form of a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation by likelihood. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t use the canonical form straight up: $ dx/dt = x^2 +r$ cannot be fit directly in this manner, since it needs a couple scale transformations on the variables to get the units right (a multiple for the unit scale and an additive factor for the zero point), and more importantly, isn&amp;rsquo;t a stochastic model so cannot assign probabilities to the outcomes.</description>

[flickr-gallery mode=&amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; tags=&amp;ldquo;quadraticfitslides&amp;rdquo; tag_mode=&amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo;]
Analysis of fits Of course these fits rely entirely on mapping the location of the stable point and the slope through that point, something they still cannot do all that well. In this parameterization the the stable intercept is $$ \hat x = \sqrt{r}+\theta $$ and slope at intercept is $$ \frac{\partial f(\hat x)}{\partial x} = -2\sqrt{r} $$ This creates a numerical optimization problem, since there is high importance on getting the mean right, and less on the variance, the routine tends to fix the combination of r and theta to get the mean right, and then cannot change r to get the slope correct without getting penalized for the loss of likelihood in changing the mean.</description>

      <description>Working from the quadratic model for the saddle node bifurcation rather than the linear (OU) model. Recall that the dynamics are:
$$dX = \left( r - (x-\theta)^2\right)dt + \beta \sqrt{X} dB_t $$
and the linear noise approximation gives a linear Fokker Planck equation such that the probability distribution is Gaussian with moments ((corrected from yesterday to scale noise, basically as pure-birth Poisson process))
$$\frac{d \hat{x}}{dt} &amp;amp;= r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 $$ $$ \frac{d \sigma^2}{dt} &amp;amp;= -2 (\hat x - \theta )\sigma^2 + \beta \left(r - (\hat{x}-\theta)^2 \right) $$</description>

$$ y(\omega) = \int0^T dt e^{i\omega t} x(t) $$ $$ S(\omega) = \lim{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2\pi T} \left| y(\omega)\right|^2 $$
A little work can show is equal to the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, $ \langle x(t) x(t&amp;rsquo;) \rangle = C(t-t&amp;rsquo;) $.
We evaluate the correlation function of their Fourier transform (note $ x (\omega) $ is really $ \tilde x(\omega)$, the new transformed variable, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the tilde only out of laziness):</description>

      <description>Matching the warning signal to different SDE models couldn&amp;rsquo;t retain the simplicity and generality needed, so I intend to work on the transformed data instead. Taking the power spectrum of the data, we have a new curve fitting problem:
(Code).Â This can be turned into a linear curve fitting problem by taking the log of the inverse Fourrier transform, then the slope is our stability parameter.Â Can we do this estimation by likelihood instead of least-squares?</description>

      <description>The last few days have involved an investigation into the ability to capture the essential features of the dynamics leading up to a saddle node bifurcation as a linear stochastic differential equation. The warning signals question then becomes a model-choice problem between constant and time-dependent coefficients:
$$ dX_t = \alpha \left(\theta_t - X_t\right) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$
and
$$ dX_t = \alpha_t (\theta_t - X_t) dt + \sigma_t dW_t $$</description>

      <description>Yesterday I began to address concerns of different models that have different mean dynamics, and how this influences the warning signals. This poses several kinds of issues.
 First, if the mean is changing, the model fitting must be appropriate to this &amp;ndash; either by fitting this rate of change or correcting for it.
 Second, the variance is expected to scale with the mean, and scale differently under different noise models (particularly environmental vs.</description>

      <description>Detecting a warning signal of collapse isn&amp;rsquo;t about detecting that a system is non-stationary, but more specifically, that the system is about to do something sudden.Â The classic saddle-node bifurcation example results in a picture like this:
A visible steady decrease interrupted by a sudden jump.Â The goal is to distinguish this from the case of a steady decrease that involves no loss of stability &amp;ndash; such as would be created by continually lowering the carrying capacity of logistic-model system at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>Progress mid-October through mid-December 80% Time: nonparametric-bayes The bulk of my time has been spent becoming familiar with the literature on Gaussian Processes and their numerical implementation. I have written my own Gaussian process code from scratch to convince myself of my understanding of the methodology, and explored some of the related numerical issues addressing computational speed and stability.
I then developed an algorithm for applying the Gaussian process inference of the state dynamics to stochastic dynamic programming methods for determining an optimal harvesting policy.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow will be meeting with my dissertation committee: Alan Hastings, Peter Wainwright, and Brian Moore. This provides a good opportunity to summarize the status of my current projects and my principle accomplishments for the year. Will try a tex&amp;rsquo;d document as I&amp;rsquo;ve done in previous years but here&amp;rsquo;s for some preliminary brainstorming.
 Summary: In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published one paper, given 4 talks (CPB, NIMBioS, Berkeley, IIASA), read 144+ articles and wrote 9000+ lines of code.</description>

      <description>Goal for today: implement analytic calculations for warning signals.
 10am-12pm  Abstraction/functionalizing code.
 4pm-7pm  Implement GSL ode solvers for linear noise approximation:
Recall our dynamics are d(n) = *e*n + a
and defining the jump moments (van Kampen) Î±~1~(n) = b(n) â d(n)
Î±~2~(n) = b(n) + d(n)

recall that we have a linear Fokker-Planck equation whose solution is Gaussian and specified by the first two moments:  These are implemented in code using GSL ode library.</description>

 Still, the approach should be able to do more than describe single points as unexpected deviates. Still need to address gradual change vs change point analysis. Essentially the same as the phyolgenentic problem &amp;ndash; one rate vs two rates. Model selection approaches? So far theory is essentially built on a model selection between linear models.</description>

      <description>Our paper, limits to the detection of early warning signals for critical transitions, has now appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Interface. An open-access copy is available under CC-by license on the ArXiv. The essence of the paper is to bring a more model-based approach to early warning signals, while seeking to remain as general as possible.
Without a model-based approach, it is difficult to leverage statistically meaningful comparisons to identify what is a real warning signal and what is just noise.</description>

Recent papers in early warning signals This invistigation is in a very similar spirit to two other recent papers on the subject. KÃ©fi et al. addresses a different kind of false positive for early warning signals, arising in systems approaching other transitions or bifurcations than the intended culprit, the saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

 Tried time averaging over the entire time window (set sample_size to 1 less than max time); in close agreement with the ensemble predictions (getting around 1355). Mystery doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually be a problem in the method, but just innate variability! Even over reasonable time-averages and ensemble averages there&amp;rsquo;s significant deviation from the expected variance! This variation around the warning signal/leading indicator is exactly what might frustrate the warning signal.</description>

      <description>bootstrapping models implemented improved handling of model classes &amp;ndash; included T, t0, N, and X0 in object def implemented plotting for model bootstrap difficulties with changePt model fit remain. fixed one source of trouble &amp;ndash; no longer passes zero-length data to OU.lik() when t_shift is outside the time interval.  Still giving errors on coercing lists into doubles for the saddle_node bifurcation simulated data set. &amp;ndash;fixed, was getting t_shift as a vector from time(X).</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping for likelihood ratios! Updated class behavior &amp;ndash; all simulation and fitting routines now return timeseries objects as data with correct range and timestep. updated plotting routines. Likelihood ratio plotting function. Bootstraps of parameters can be plotted using the output from the likelihood ratio fit simulation, avoiding redundancy, just specify which model is desired. Bootstrap likelihood ratio plots includes the original ratio and calculates plot range using this information.</description>

      <description>Summary  Have a functional likelihood calculation from the full individual-based simulation, see Friday. Accuracy needs more testing, and the computation is probably too slow for optimization routines. Have an implementation of the linear decrease in stability model with analytic conditional probability density. Needed a couple adjustments today. Need to add direct simulation to the warning signals package, currently retunrs only time-averaged/ensemble averaged stats. Can be approximated by setting the window equal to the timestep and ensembles equal to one.</description>
