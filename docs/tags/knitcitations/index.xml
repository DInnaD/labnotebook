      <description>EDIT: Note that this package has evolved quite a bit from this initial post. While the basic interface is the same, support for additional features and some choices in formatting differ from what is presented here. Please see the README for the latest introduction to the package. Readers may also be interested in the more recent post discussing the introduction of several new features including semantic tools in the knitcitations package</description>
