      <description>RNeXML Character metadata EML provides a nice illustration of the kind of metadata we would want to typically accompany character trait data; at minimum, at the attribute level.
Some of this is already there &amp;ndash; we know if states are continuous or discrete, what possible states they can take on, and can add labels to state nodes to define what the symbols mean (however, perhaps an additional meta annotation node would be preferred).</description>

      <description>RNeXML  Feedback from Rutger, need to add about attributes so that RDFa abstraction references the right level of the DOM (issue #35).
 Looking for strategy for distilling RDF from RDFa in R, see my question on SO. Hopefully don&amp;rsquo;t have to wrap some C library myself&amp;hellip;  nonparametric-bayes Writing writing.
 Update pandoc templates to use yaml metadata for author, affiliation, abstract, etc. Avoids having to manually edit the elsarticle.</description>
