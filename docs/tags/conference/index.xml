      <description>WSSSPE working groups: Reproducibility, Reuse, and Sharing (Neil Che Hong) Our group focused on journal policies regarding software papers. Our objectives were:
 A Survey of journals that publish software papers. The Software Sustainability Institute already maintains a list
 A summary of policies each of these journals has in place regarding software papers. (e.g. licensing requirements, repository requirements, required sections in the manuscripts regarding installation or tests, etc).</description>

      <description>MBI Workshop Paul Armsworth Very nice example of control in creating a market for ecosystem services for landowners. Key feature is that multiple land-owners respond by adjusting their prices, and so payments can be divided into fraction going into subsidy and fraction going into conservation. When one land-owner controls land that is particularly good cost per conservation accomplished, they also stand to gain largest value.
Also looked at auction mechanism and impact of cooperation among landowners to create hold outs.</description>

      <description>Near the end of another excellent day of discussions we were asked to put pen to paper to outline our own views in writing. My own contribution was the following notebook scribble.
My own vision of what ISEES should be doing for workforce development:
ISEES would employ a multi-scale approach to improve basic computational expertise across the entire workforce necessary to fully participate in the modern software-immersed world of research through the development of training standards, while using a working-group model focused on emerging researcher-developer communities which would simultaneously improve the quality and synthesis of existing software tools while also delivering essential skills to the most transformative members of the research software communities.</description>

      <description>Education / Workforce Development Group Cannot do grand synthesis opaquely and be science. must be able to scale and evolve.
How did data succeed? What features really made the difference and what were just sideshows?
 Sticks (Funder and journal mandates?) Working groups (NCEAS) Training external forces: there is more data.
  Why one center? Why not 15 centers? Divided by discipline rather than region&amp;hellip;. synthesize the synthesis centers</description>

      <description>From Thursday Nov 1 through Saturday Nov 3 I attended the PLoS Altmetrics workshop as a member of the ROpensci project. An exciting meeting driven mostly by the opportunity to interact with a small and incredibly creative and innovative group of science publishers, funders, start-ups, and other researchers. Details of the event are largely recorded on the altmetrics 2012 workshop website. We also have a few slides addressing the ropensci slant.</description>

      <description>Fantastic first day at Evolution. Spent the morning in the SSB Sympossium organized by Jeremy Brown, &amp;ldquo;Predictive approaches for assessing the fit of evolutionary models&amp;rdquo;. Really covered both methods assessing model fit (posterior predictive simulations) and approximate likelihood approaches, which are also simulation-based. Then the afternoon in the second SSB Symposium on emerging methods for comparative phylogenetics, organized by Liam Revell and Cecile Ane, which included my talk. Lots of great talks, but Cecile&amp;rsquo;s was perhaps the most striking results I saw presented all day.</description>

      <description>The rOpenSci Project Carl Boettiger, Scott Chamberlain, Karthik Ram Sharing scientific data is a win for individual scientists as well as for the larger enterprise of other researchers, publishers, funders, educators, and the general public. Despite the rapid increase of public data, most researchers continue to work on their own data just as before.¬†We lack the both the tools and training to quickly and easily leverage such data.¬†To address some of these challenges, we have created the rOpenSci project.</description>

      <description>Great second day at the Data to Knowledge conference (a few notes below).
Also I have been trying to move a few projects forward during the commute and break. I&amp;rsquo;ve sent Alan my revisions on the prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s fallacy manuscript, getting pretty close. Following up on a query from John, ran a simulation showing the impact of having a delay in the timeseries before the slow change towards the bifurcation begins.</description>

 Similarity search is the fundamental problem for any task This problem is now solved. As effective as possible, as efficient as possible.  What is similarity search? All about required invariances: Looking at ancient manuscripts of fish &amp;ndash; identify multiple drawings of the same species. Invariant to color, scale, and orientation.

      <description>Great last day of the conference, despite¬†noticeably¬†decreased attendance. Once again just pulling in my tweets, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to transcribe proper notes. Meanwhile, some of the bloggers have done a rather nice day-to-day coverage; no idea how they all manage to keep up. Links below, with a nice mix of those targeting more theory oriented, more application oriented and more outreach oriented sessions.

      <description>Hope to process the day&amp;rsquo;s happenings later, meanwhile just a snapshot of my twitter-stream notes. My own highlights certainly include Steve Pacala&amp;rsquo;s fantastic plenary session in receiving the MacArthur award, and¬†Mark Urban&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear presentation on &amp;ldquo;climate collisions.&amp;rdquo; I thought I was less tolerant of data-free models with arbitrary assumptions these days, but somehow Mark just swept those concerns away. In pointing out really fundamental concepts, such details just aren&amp;rsquo;t so important.</description>

      <description>Thanks to everyone who participated in the CSGF 2010 Survey.With too many things going on this year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t conduct a survey at the 2011 Conference.¬†But as people were asking about the survey, I thought I could at least make last year&amp;rsquo;s summary a bit more accessible.¬†The following comes from the pdf report I submitted to Krell and a few example figures from data.This year&amp;rsquo;s survey was longer and broader, recieving over 90 responses from fellows and alumni.</description>

      <description>Second day of the conference. Many of the talks I most want to see are coming up Monday and Tuesday, and I have a bit more to do to prepare my own talk, so I take it a bit light on sessions. Highlight of the day was definitely the discussion with Mark McPeek and the other journal editors during and following the &amp;ldquo;Happy hour with the editors&amp;rdquo; session, which was perhaps the best event of the conference, despite a rather unimpressive attendance.</description>

      <description>Finished up my SICB presentation tweaks, slides now up on slideshare, flying off to the conference tomorrow.¬†Created this in OpenOffice, started adding animations and then decided it would be more reliable to just duplicate slides to have parts appear (really just for the explanation of the likelihood ratio distributions under each model).¬†Next time think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with my usual inkscape slides tied together with latex beamer, the lack of vector images in this one is not ideal.</description>

MNV I briefly sketched the multivariate normal solution for joint probability across the tree under the regimes model. The original regimes approach did not take advantage of the fact that the solution to the joint probability across the tree is multivariate normal given the painting. This allows the calculation to be partitioned as outlined in Saturday&amp;rsquo;s entry:</description>

      <description>Quantifying Information in a Phylogenetic Tree: The Robustness of Phylogenetic Signal Since Felsenstein (1985)&amp;rsquo;s influential paper on phylogenetic contrasts, phylogenetically-based inferences of evolutionary patterns have gotten increasingly more complex (Hansen, 1997; Butler and King, 2004; Freckleton and Harvey, 2006; O&amp;rsquo;Meara et al., 2006; Pagel and Meade, 2006). More and more sophisticated models are applied to datasets of species mean traits on a phylogenetic tree in an attempt to answer such questions as reconstructing ancestral states, identify changes in rates of character evolution across time and across clades, identify the number and location of evolutionary optima or the strength of stabilizing selection.</description>

      <description>Notes potentially for my EDG talk.
&amp;ldquo;Keeping Up&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a talk to EDG? Science is growing. Fast. Number of papers published. Genomes on Genbank. Software on CRAN. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s felt the pressure. So what do we do? Keeping with tradition, I&amp;rsquo;ll present my own work in developing comparative phylogenetic methods to identify niche differentiation in Labrid fish. I will try and use this context to pose the question &amp;ndash; what do we do about this information explosion?</description>
