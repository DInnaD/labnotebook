      <description>Some quick thoughts on learning Jekyll After recieving a few queries on how to get started with Jekyll I thought I&amp;rsquo;d jot down my own opinions here. Of course there is already rather good documentation for the software and plenty of blogs providing tutorials. While no doubt more than adequate, I have more opinions on how to get started actually learning what&amp;rsquo;s going on than I could easily fit into a tweet, and also a couple favorite links to references so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d jot down my reply in long form here.</description>

      <title>Automated feeds in notebook entries</title>

      <description>Exploring the use of automated feeds in my notebook entries, which would make writing posts both faster and more complete. I had recently modified my Jekyll plugins to include commits on the day of the post. Consequently, I could add a bit of liquid code to any post, such as:
{% raw %}
{% octokit_commits pdg_control%}  {% endraw %}
(or even to the post template) and have the commit log for the specified repository automatically imported.</description>

      <title>Solarized Colors with Twitter-Bootstrap?</title>

      <description>Trying out rendering my notebook using Ethan Schoonover&amp;rsquo;s Solarized color scheme. The solarized palette has been selected according to Ethan&amp;rsquo;s exacting standards for contrast, symmetry, and readability.
My site CSS is built with Twitter-Bootstrap, which uses LESS to generate CSS files. Normal CSS is valid LESS code too, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the concept of a variable. So changing colors in CSS requires changing each and every occurance of some hex colorcode.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my lab notebook, version 3.0. My original open lab notebooks began on the wiki platform OpenWetWare, moved to a personally hosted Wordpress platform, and now run on a Jekyll-powered platform (site-config), but the basic idea remains the same. For completeness, earlier entries from both platforms have been migrated here. Quoting from my original introduction to the Wordpress notebook:

      <description>This Open Lab Notebook started on a public MediaWiki-based site, OpenWetWare (OWW), which was created with the ambitious vision of having a single wiki for biological sciences (or at least, synthetic microbiology, since such the wiki grew out of a collection of such labs). Users could have their own pages that served as a personal website or lab group site, contribute pages on specific protocols, host course websites, and most interestingly, were encouraged to create open lab notebooks using specially designed templates for the purpose.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a recent bugfix in the exitwp scripts I was able to export all my Wordpress entries. The script pulls the entries from the Wordpress database and formats them in markdown, along with extracting all metadata such as timestamp, tags, categories, publication status, and Wordpress id number, which are all embedded as YAML header information.
Why migrate the old entries? When I moved to the Jekyll notebook, I left the Wordpress site standing with all its existing content and simply remapped the home pages.</description>

      <description>Jekyll works wonderfully with little knowledge beyond basic html/css to create _layout templates and then you&amp;rsquo;re free to write beautiful pages and posts in markdown. But adding more dynamic content, the kind of cool stuff avialable in so many wordpress plugins, tends to require a little understanding of the template formatting language, Liquid. Liquid is actually super simple and powerful way to build a dynamic website. The project&amp;rsquo;s wiki provides a great introduction, starting with</description>

      <description>Mostly getting Prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s Fallacy example to run with large enough sample sizes. Finer sampling or more replicates than current settings seems to crash MPI connections over farm cluster, probably a memory issue. Oh well, looks like I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good enough sample size here.
 Prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s Fallacy  Citations on Jekyll No ideal solution here at the moment, a couple options:
 Pandoc: My intended solution, Disadvantages: converts everything to it&amp;rsquo;s own markdown format, which messes up my PHP Markdown tables and YAML frontmatter.</description>

      <description>I am trying out Jekyll as an alternative to Wordpress for powering this site and my open lab notebook. If you subscribe, the new RSS (atom) feed for the new notebook is at http://carlboettiger.info/atom.xml. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any feedback, good or bad, about the switch. A recent post gives my own reflections. The site&amp;rsquo;s source-code is available on github.

      <title>Jekyll vs Wordpress</title>
      <link>/2012/05/01/jekyll-vs-wordpress/</link>

      <description>I am now trying out a Jekyll-based platform rather than a Wordpress based for my website and lab notebook. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, the Wordpress site still remains where it was with links intact, I&amp;rsquo;ve simply remapped the homepage. For now this is an experiment, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.
Why switch? Speed Wordpress was great, meeting most of my needs for a customizable site that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really accomplish in my first online notebook on OpenWetWare.</description>
