  knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) { if (!options$split) return(x) cat(x, file = fig_path(&#39;.md&#39;, options)) }   Consider more intuitive function names rather than function arguments?  TreeBase  Needs additional functions replacing sapply queries and argument queries. Table of functions re-organize presentation  rOpenSci GSOC GSoC applications were due at noon today.</description>

      <title>Robust control &amp; uncertainty - reading notes</title>

      <description>Ecologists/TREE (Fischer et. al. 2009), (Polasky et. al. 2011) give a nice overview/introduction to the problem. Perhaps most interestingly, both set up resilience approaches as a foil or alternate approach in contrast to a decision-theoretic problem. Fischer&amp;rsquo;s group does a particularly nice job handling the case that these two are separate approaches &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dismiss resilience thinking as fuzzy optimization of fuzzy objective functions.
The Polasky piece does a nice job refocusing us on the obvious but brushed-over question of the objective function.</description>

      <description>Day 3 of my short-term visitor stay before the working group starts.
 Wednesday: Travel
 Thursday: 8:45 Group Meeting: Paul, Michael, Lance, Dan, Jake, Carl.
  Training problem II discussion &amp;ndash; problem taxonomy: stochastic , model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, state uncertainty. Learning on uncertainty (passive/adaptive active management) in the uncertainty cases, all of which increase the parameter space. Evening with Paul&amp;rsquo;s students.
 Friday Writing up Training problem II with Jake, Michael.</description>

      <description>Reading Catching up on journal table-of-contents/rss readings.
News Australia Researchers unhappy (unknown, 2011)
Climate change and Open Science Nature debate on the Berkeley climate team&amp;rsquo;s (BEST) press release in advance of publication. (unknown, 2011) Editor critiques the stunt:
 Richard Muller, the physicist in charge, even told the BBC: &amp;ldquo;That is the way I practised science for decades; it was the way everyone practised it until some magazines — particularly Science and Nature — forbade it.</description>

      <description>Very interesting article on tipping points that seems to answer a question I put to Vasilis back in 2009 at IIASA: whether critical transitions due to bifurcations could be distinguished from stochastic transitions due to rare events Ditlevsen &amp;amp; Johnsen, 2010. Argues that some of the well-known climate transitions may have been stochastic transitions instead. Will need a closer read to better assess how they are distinguishing between such transitions in the data.</description>

      <description>Reading  Oikos journal recently started a rather nice blog. A journal long responsible for some of the best examples of developing and confronting ecological theory with empirical results, with an commendable emphasis on general principles and synthesis, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see them enter the Web2.0 ecosystem. Editor Jeremy Fox has a nice introduction to the goals of the blog &amp;ndash; check out the &amp;ldquo;new ideas&amp;rdquo; categories for worthwhile reading.</description>

      <description>Reading Vasilis&amp;rsquo;s PLoS ONE warning signals methods out, listing different methods and announcing the earlywarings R package: 10.1371/journal.pone.0041010, and another comparing methods on some various data sets 10.1371/journal.pone.0038410, which (like Drake) advocates for a mixed method approach.
Modeling extreme risks in ecology 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01871.x
Which is kinda like Richard Katz&amp;rsquo;s extreme value theory in ecology article.
NSF call for Decision, Risk and Management Science, see previously funded examples.
A paper in Eco Lett suggests model-guided field work 10.</description>

      <description>My recent paper with Alan Hastings, &amp;ldquo;Early warning signals and the prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s fallacy&amp;rdquo;, is now out in PRSB. An open access preprint can be found on the (arXiv) and accompanying (source code) for the analysis can be found on Github.
Recent papers in early warning signals This invistigation is in a very similar spirit to two other recent papers on the subject. Kéfi et al. addresses a different kind of false positive for early warning signals, arising in systems approaching other transitions or bifurcations than the intended culprit, the saddle-node bifurcation.</description>
