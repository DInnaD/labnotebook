      <description>My last post was a bit pessimistic, sometimes I can still miss the forest for the trees. Hidden in those figures, the main point has been staring me in the face. So let&amp;rsquo;s try this again.
Stochastic limits to evolutionary branching is the story of two dueling timescales. The first timescale is that of the evolutionary process: the frequency of steps (mutation rate, $ \mu$) and the size of the steps (mutation kernel standard deviation $ \sigma_{\mu}$), on top of which we add the selection gradient, created by the ecology.</description>

      <description>Ran a series of simulations overnight to explore aspects of time-to-branching at different phases of the branching process. Still using only 16 replicates per data point, though increased maximum time for a run another order of magnitude to avoid timing out runs influencing the dataset for the slow-rate parameters. Still seems to suggest a regime beyond which branching becomes completely improbable. Not clear that the transition is a sharp as the Arrhenius approximation might suggest.</description>

      <description>Setting up some adaptive dynamics simulations to complete the parameter-space search. Currently the demo library contains two files, providing the coexistence-only tests and the full evolutionary simulation. This picks up from Aug 30/Sept 1 on coexistence times and Aug 12&amp;frasl;13 entries on waiting times until branching (while still on OWW).
coexistence times coexist_times.R creates contour plots of the coexistence time under demographic noise expected at a particular position of the pairwise invasibility plot (PIP).</description>

      <description>Adaptive dynamics is a set of recently developed techniques for understanding phenotypic evolution, using a dynamical systems approach to concepts from evolutionary game theory. In contrast to population genetics, this approach tends to explore richer ecological interactions and simpler genetic assumptions, with significant controversy. My own work has focused on a particular element of the theory known as the canonical equation, a macroscopic equation describing the deterministic rate of evolution.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up paper on waiting time to branching in adaptive dynamics. Cleaning up code from summer. Now in a local git repository in adaptiveDynamics/code Moved ensemble parallelization to higher level, so parallelization can be performed in R or C. Adding documentation  Current status  Calculates the waiting time to complete phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 successfully from individual-based simulation.  Phase 1 ~ Completed when 2 branches exist over threshold Phase 2 ~ Completed when a third population has established over threshold exterior to a stable pair Phase 3 ~ Completed when two populations over threshold are separated in traitspace by more than finishline units</description>

      <description>Matching theoretical approximations to simulation:
 Implemented the first analytic approximation, calculating the waiting time to complete phase 1. Established dimophisms are often still lost, hence the first successful completion of phase 1 (dimorphic population in coexistence region with each above threshold size) doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the time of the last completion of phase 1. Phase 2, an established third population seems to happen soon after the last successful phase 1, giving the illusion this step is easy rather than the reality that this process requires fast traversal to persist past the coexistence time.</description>

      <description>Modified code phase definitions: phasetime[0] is the first time dimorphism is established. Dimorphism may be lost and restablished, last (most recent) time it establishes is phasetime1. Other times are still the most recent time at which the phase was accomplished.
 Fiddling with analytic approximations. These shouldn&amp;rsquo;t integrate to evaluate at each value, but should be done in a fully discretized system. Prototyping in R, the discrete version is probably fast enough to handle in scripted code alone.</description>

      <description>Wide gap, flat landscape  Waiting times on a flatter landscape: sigma_c ~ sigma_k. Waiting times are dominated by the number of times phase 3 collapses: the established invader in a dimorphic population (right panels). Collapse of phase 2: collapse of the dimorphism before third population can establish is much rarer (about an order of magnitude).   from the run3 dataset, with parameters.  Narrower gap, steeper landscape  with sigma_c &amp;lt;&amp;lt; sigma_k, branching is easy, neither phase is particularly limiting, though single collapses from both phases are very common.</description>

      <description>Public code hosting  Project code now available through Github. Advantages to public hosting: Replication of adaptive dynamics simulations can be difficult, particularly in matching various nuisance parameters. While there is certainly much pedagogical value in individual researchers implementing their own simulations, verification and reproducibility of scientific results would be greatly facilitated by adapting an accepted open source code base and adding branches, etc. Researchers could much more immediately benefit from the work of their colleagues and spend more time implementing novel research and less reproducing it.</description>

 use more points for the simulation, and don&amp;rsquo;t put them on a regular grid, but maybe draw them from a uniform distribution, so as not to create spurious impressions of symmetry. You could then maybe also use the tripack package to draw colored Voronoi cells instead of same-sized symbols.</description>

Notebooks and files Looking at a better way to get figures into my online notebook. I often run simulations that generate figures which I look at, make some adjustments to the code based on the figure, and then delete or overwrite the figure without uploading it to my notebook, because it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; and uploading takes a lot of clicks, particularly when the code generates 36 figures in a run.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow will be meeting with my dissertation committee: Alan Hastings, Peter Wainwright, and Brian Moore. This provides a good opportunity to summarize the status of my current projects and my principle accomplishments for the year. Will try a tex&amp;rsquo;d document as I&amp;rsquo;ve done in previous years but here&amp;rsquo;s for some preliminary brainstorming.
 Summary: In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published one paper, given 4 talks (CPB, NIMBioS, Berkeley, IIASA), read 144+ articles and wrote 9000+ lines of code.</description>

      <description>Higher resolution power plot for Anoles tree Figure (below right) shows power for increasing alpha in the Anoles tree. The vertical line shows the estimated value of alpha for the body-size data &amp;ndash; unlikely that a tree of this size can detect selection that is this weak even if it were present. Consequently, this fit should not be taken as evidence that BM is a better fit than the OU, but rather that the data is insufficient to inform this analysis.</description>
