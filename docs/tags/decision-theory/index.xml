      <description>Value of information  Reed with uniform large noise, logistic map Reed with uniform large noise Reed with uniform small noise Sethi with uniform small noise, logistic map. Sethi with large noise Doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. hmm.. voi_sethi_parameters.md , running value of information setup but with small noise &amp;amp; logistic map. Whoops, this example solves uniform noise but simulates log-normal noise, which probably explains the positive effect of growth noise once again.</description>

      <description>Tour of existing files (version stable links)
 managed warning is the current direct test of this, but needs decently ranged input example where detection has a good chance to succeed.
 criticaltransition Statistics across replicate crashes that don&amp;rsquo;t show much promise for detection.
 A heuristic implementation in response to the detection of a signal might use a simple rule like a fraction of the optimal harvest of a stable system.</description>

      <description>No idea where I went wrong, but the final graphs are not what I expected Update: Integrated out some uncertainty in the expectation step, need to preserve full set of transtions
We consider adding additional sources of noise through observation error and implementation error to the orginal model of Reed (1979), which considers only growth error. This follows in the line of exploration taken by Clark and Kirkwood (1987), Roughgarden (1996) and Sethi (2006).</description>

      <description>Let
 y be measured stock size, subject to measurement error from true stock x q be harvest quota, subject to implementation error from actual harvest, h  Stock next year is also subject to stochastic growth shock $z_g$, (note that $f$ will also depend on the harvest, h, unless $x_t$ is taken as the escapement population, $x-h$).
$$ x_{t+1} = z_g f(x_t) $$
In discrete space, let X be a vector representing the probability distribution of having stock $x$ at time $t$, restricted to some finite grid of dimension $n$.</description>

      <description>Consider a stock $x_t$ at time $t$ that recruits stochastically following harvest $h_t$ from the escaped population ($s_t := x_t - ht$), $x{t+1} = z_g f(s_t)$, where $z_g$ is a multiplicative stochastic shock to the growth. We imagine the decision maker sets a policy determining the harvest quota $q_t$ each year, which is implemented as the real harvest with some error $z_i$, $h_t = z_i q_t$. Before setting a quota, the decision maker assesses the stock $y_t = z_m x_t$, so $y$ is a noisy measurement of the true stock $x$.</description>

      <description>Straight-forward tasks can sometimes take forever. In advance of our upcoming conference call for the Pretty Darn Good Control (pdg-control) NIMBioS working group, I had a few remaining issues to touch up in Figures 3 and 4.
Figure 3 shows harvest and stock dynamics under the different functional forms fo the cost. The goal is to provide a very intuitive, visual sense of how the policies differ under these different functional forms, such as a fixed &amp;ldquo;transaction fee&amp;rdquo; (fixed) or a cost that is proportional to the size of the change in policy (L1), or the square of that change (L2), etc.</description>

      <description>pdg-control After reading Costello et. al. (2010), taking a look at value of information in a dynamic context. Consider the model of Sethi et. al. (2005) (Costello is part of et al); a dynamic fisheries model with stochastic growth (a la Reed, (1979)), stochastic measurement assessing the stock size, and stochastic implementation of the harvest. I first imagine the case where the real system is quite deterministic, say, with a tiny amount of growth stochasticity only.</description>

 Clarify this! is (profit from growth only) the case in which (a) the manager includes growth noise in the solution when in reality it is absent (hence the deterministic solution is optimal), (b) the case where the manager includes growth noise and it is present (i.</description>

      <description>Debug Sethi with large uniform noise: needed to avoid havest &amp;gt; stock in definition of f.
  I ran the value of information calculations using the Sethi settings of a logistic map and uniform noise, which does indeed replicate their results, where the measurement error escapement is lower than the &amp;ldquo;all low noise&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;deterministic&amp;rdquo;) escapement until stock get above carrying capacity. results
Kinda of interesting that this patterns isn&amp;rsquo;t robust to the noise distribution; I still find the lognormal noise pattern a bit more intuitive.</description>

      <description>Value of information The motivation for this &amp;ldquo;value of information&amp;rdquo; excercise comes from Costello et al. (2010), which essentially compares two scenarios: the value of a marine protected area when you the dispersal kernel is unknown (one of a discrete set of possible kernels you sum over), to the value of the protected area when the kernel is known perfectly. No intrinsic stochasticity, single time step, no learning.
The model I&amp;rsquo;m looking at comes from Reed (1979), and a modification by Sethi et al.</description>

      <description>Seems that the level of caution observed in the deterministic scenario relative to the increasing noise scenarios comes, perhaps not surprisingly, from the addition of harvesting costs, rather than from overcompensatory dynamics or the asymmetric forms of the noise, which seem to have quantitative but not qualitative differences.
