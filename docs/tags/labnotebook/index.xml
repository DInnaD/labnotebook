      <description>For a while now most of my active research is developed through .Rmd scripts connected to a particular project repository (something I discuss at length in deep challenges with knitr workflows). In the previous post I discuss creating a template package with a more transparent organization of files, such as moving manuscripts from inst/doc/ to simply manuscripts/. This left these exploratory analysis scripts in inst/examples in a similarly unintuitive place.</description>

      <description>Labnotebook  Configure Github CDN Hmm, jekyll-assets. Not sure that this is preferable from just using the makefile to compile and minify assets seperately as needed. Move www.carlboettiger.info to host from gh-pages branch of labnotebook. This self-contained system is more standard, and it is strange for other gh-pages hosting to be using the same domain/subdomain to reference content that is actually on a gh-pages branch of some totally different repository.</description>
