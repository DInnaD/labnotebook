<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This post was originally drafted as a set of questions to the revived <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ropensci-discuss">ropensci-discuss list</a>, hopefully readers might join the discussion from there.</p>
<p>Been thinking about Docker and the discussion about reproducible research in the comments of Rich et al’s recent post on the <a href="ropensci.org/blog/2014/06/09/reproducibility/">rOpenSci blog</a> where quite a few of people mentioned the potential for Docker as a way to facilitate this.</p>
<p>I’ve only just started playing around with Docker, and though I’m quite impressed, I’m still rather skeptical that non-crazies would ever use it productively. Nevertheless, I’ve worked up some Dockerfiles to explore how one might use this approach to transparently document and manage a computational environment, and I was hoping to get some feedback from all of you.</p>
<p>For those of you who are already much more familiar with Docker than me (or are looking for an excuse to explore!), I’d love to get your feedback on some of the particulars. For everyone, I’d be curious what you think about the general concept.</p>
<p>So far I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/docker-ubuntu-r/blob/master/add-r-ropensci/Dockerfile">dockerfile</a> and <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cboettig/ropensci-docker/">image</a></p>
<p>If you have docker up and running, perhaps you can give it a test drive:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it cboettig/ropensci-docker /bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>You should find R installed with some common packages. This image builds on Dirk Eddelbuettel’s R docker images and serves as a starting point to test individual R packages or projects.</p>
<p>For instance, my RNeXML manuscript draft is a bit more of a bear then usual to run, since it needs <code>rJava</code> (requires external libs), <code>Sxslt</code> (only available on Omegahat and requires extra libs) and latest <code>phytools</code> (a tar.gz file from Liam’s website), along with the usual mess of pandoc/latex environment to compile the manuscript itself. By building on ropensci-docker, we need a <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/tree/master/manuscripts/Dockerfile">pretty minimal docker file</a> to compile this environment:</p>
<p>You can test drive it (<a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cboettig/rnexml">docker image here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it cboettig/rnexml /bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>Once in bash, launch R and run <code>rmarkdown::render(&quot;manuscript.Rmd&quot;)</code>. This will recompile the manuscript from cache and leave you to interactively explore any of the R code shown.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-goals">Advantages / Goals</h2>
<p>Being able to download a pre-compiled image means a user can run the code without dependency hell (often not as much an R problem as it is in Python, but nevertheless one that I hit frequently, particularly as my projects age), and also without altering their personal R environment. Third (in principle) this makes it easy to run the code on a cloud server, scaling the computing resources appropriately.</p>
<p>I think the real acid test for this is not merely that it recreates the results, but that others can build and extend on the work (with fewer rather than more barriers than usual). I believe most of that has nothing to do with this whole software image thing – providing the methods you use as general-purpose functions in an R package, or publishing the raw (&amp; processed) data to Dryad with good documentation will always make work more modular and easier to re-use than cracking open someone’s virtual machine. But that is really a separate issue.</p>
<p>In this context, we look for an easy way to package up whatever a researcher or group is already doing into something portable and extensible. So, is this really portable and extensible?</p>
<h2 id="concerns">Concerns:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This presupposes someone can run docker on their OS – and from the command line at that. Perhaps that’s the biggest barrier to entry right now, (though given docker’s virulent popularity, maybe something smart people with big money might soon solve).</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to interact with thing is through a bash shell running on the container. An RStudio server might be much nicer, but I haven’t been able to get that running. <em>Anyone know how to run RStudio server from docker?</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>(I tried &amp; <a href="https://github.com/mingfang/docker-druid/issues/2">failed</a>)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>I don’t see how users can move local files on and off the docker container. In some ways this is a great virtue – forcing all code to use fully resolved paths like pulling data from Dryad instead of their hard-drive, and pushing results to a (possibly private) online site to view them. But obviously a barrier to entry. <em>Is there a better way to do this?</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternative-strategies">Alternative strategies</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Docker is just one of many ways to do this (particularly if you’re not concerned about maximum performance speed), and quite probably not the easiest. Our friends at Berkeley D-Lab opted for a GUI-driven virtual machine instead, built with Packer and run in Virtualbox, after their experience proved that students were much more comfortable with the mouse-driven installation and a pixel-identical environment to the instructor’s (see their excellent <a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/w424gdjot3tgksidyyfl">paper</a> on this).</p></li>
<li><p>Will/should researchers be willing to work and develop in virtual environments? In some cases, the virtual environment can be closely coupled to the native one – you use your own editors etc to do all the writing, and then execute in the virtual environment (seems this is easier in docker/vagrant approach than in the BCE.</p></li>
</ol>
<!--

I would like a way for a collaborator who knows a little R to be able to open my .Rmd manuscript on his/her own computer, edit some parameters, recompile and view the pdf. RStudio w/ rmarkdown has gone a long way to making that happen.

<div class="excerpt">
<h2 id="berkeley-collaborative-environment">Berkeley Collaborative Environment</h2>
<p>Trying out the Berkeley image (Essentially ubuntu 14.04 XFCE with ipython and RStudio installed, but finely tuned to improve user experience; e.g. solid colors for faster remote window connections.)</p>
<p>Highly recommend <a href="https://t.co/TJ9ObbL8i8">their paper</a> for the first explanation I’ve actually been able to follow that provides a definition of “DevOpts” (essentially, using scripts rather than documentation to manage consistent cross-platform installation) and explains the differences and similarities between the various programs operating in this sphere, sometimes as alternatives and simultaneously.</p>
<h4 id="virtual-machines.">Virtual machines.</h4>
<p>Their approach focuses on running on top of a complete virtual machine. Primarily considers Oracle’s <code>virtualbox</code> for local use, Amazon’s AMI for cloud use. (For an emerging alternative to the full virtual machine approach, they discuss Docker).</p>
<h4 id="configuration-management-cm-tools">Configuration management (CM) tools:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ansible</strong> (“playbooks”) used by the BCE to specify the complete software environment. Compares to: <strong>Chef</strong> (Ruby-based, “recipes”), <strong>Salt</strong> (Python based, “states”), and <strong>Puppet</strong> (“manifests”).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="provisioning-tools">Provisioning tools:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Packer</strong> Used at build time to create a machine image for the VM. Packer can use Ansible/Chef/Salt/Puppet files to do this. Results in a nice AMI for Amazon web console or an image for the virtualbox GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vagrant</strong> Offers a different approach. Rather than the developer creating a VM image using Packer and Ansible script that is ready to run on virtualbox or Amazon, the end user installs vagrant instead of virtualbox. Vagrant also handles the job of Packer, in preparing an environment to run (on Vagrant’s virtual machine, rather than on virtualbox). (Note that conversely, Packer can create a Vagrant virtual machine just as easily as it can create the Oracle virtualbox or Amazon AMI). Vagrant feels a lot more native, as the user works within their familiar OS tools for editing, etc, while vagrant makes sure that the executation of the software happens in a controlled, identical environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker</strong> offers a more modular alternative to a full virtual machine, with performance that is more like running on ‘bare metal’, sharing the kernel of the native OS; though at the moment it requires that be a linux kernel. Docker is typically deployed using Vagrant, (though stand-alone setup is emerging).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From first glance, Vagrant sounds like a more elegant approach than having end users install Oracle’s virtual machine and then learn to live in a virtual window emulating the Ubuntu-XFCE desktop (particularly if those users are developers!). However, it seems that the BCE team found that Vagrant was harder for students to work with, since it required knowledge of the commandline.</p>
<p>The paper also provides a fabulous case study of a major scientific software project using the “DevOpts” philosophy but without any of these new and emerging tools, relying only on scripts, makefiles, and Linux distribution package managers.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive-impressions">Test drive impressions</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, no luck getting virtualization running on my laptop (due to <a href="ttps://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool/issues/created_by/cboettig">BIOS issues</a>). Testing on Ubuntu desktop required a newer version of virtualbox than what’s in the 12.04 repos, but otherwise just worked. It’s straight forward to install additional needed software, and virtualbox gives the option of perserving the machine state on exit, presumably with the software. Not clear how that should be managed to avoid re-creating the problems that using a consistent image set out to avoid in the first place; perhaps requires re-provisioning a divergent image?</p>
<p>Nice experience testing out the Amazon machine image, but I think the workflow would be improved if it provided RStudio server for a more interactive interface.</p>

<li><p>RNeXML manuscript edits from Francois’s comments</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-namespaces-in-r">Thoughts on namespaces (in R)</h2>
<p><em>Chatting with Scott about namespace practices, thought I’d put some of this down.</em></p>
<p>I go back and forth on having a small namespace (particularly vs convenience functions). It is certainly easier to maintain, but from the user’s perspective I think it’s pretty easy to just ignore extra functions; as long as it’s well documented what functions they need to know to get started.</p>
<p>I guess if a user needs to know too many functions to do anything, than it becomes hard to keep track of. That’s partly why I started wrapping exposed functions. For instance, you can just use <code>nexml_write</code> all the time and never use add_characters, add_trees, etc, since <code>nexml_write</code> takes additional trees and characters as arguments.</p>
<p>But I like function calls to be as semantic as possible so the code is more self documenting. Sometimes <code>add_characters(nex)</code> is more self explanatory than <code>nexml_write(nex, characters = characters)</code>.</p>
<p>The XML package really got me started on this. There’s usually like 4 or 5 ways to do the same thing. Sometimes that’s really annoying, but sometimes it helps write more transparent code or less verbose code (e.g. adding child nodes with <code>addChildren</code> vs passing as <code>.children</code> argument to <code>newXMLNode</code> – the former tends to be more semantic, the latter often more consise).</p>

<pre class="vim"><code>au BufRead,BufNewFile *.Rmd set filetype=pandoc</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Enable sytnax highlighting inside code blocks, by language. In vim session, do: <code>PandocHighlight r</code>. Unfortunately doesn’t recognize the default <code>.Rmd</code> format used by RStudio. This then enables syntax highlighting, folding, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I recall correctly, knitr’s default markdown syntax,</p>
<pre><code>```{r}</code></pre>
<p>was intended to be a valid markdown syntax. It seems Github Flavored markdown is happy to recognize this as markdown syntax for a code block in the R language, but while pandoc recognizes this as a code block, it does not recognize the language.</p>
<p>I believe Pandoc does recognize the format</p>
<pre><code>```{.r options}</code></pre>
<p>as the notation to specify the R language in this notation. I like this notation because it means that pandoc-aware syntax highlighters will highlight my code chunks as R code, which does not happen in the default syntax.</p>
<p>I realize I could define this as an input hook for knitr, but am reluctant to do so as it makes my code slightly less familiar/less portable to other users (e.g. RStudio expects and integrates with only the standard notation.)</p>

<p style="font-style:italic"> 21 Jul 2014</p>

<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Random idea for possible further exploration:</em></p>
<p>The use of ‘big data’ by UPS to perform lots of small efficiency gains seems to be everybody’s favorite example (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/05/02/308640135/episode-536-the-future-of-work-looks-like-a-ups-truck">NPR</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21607816-businesses-should-aim-lots-small-wins-big-data-add-up-something-big-little">The Economist</a>). During a typical applications of optimal control for ecological conservation talk yesterday I couldn’t help thinking back to that story. The paradigm shift is not so much the kind or amount of the data being used as it is the control levers themselves. As the Economist (rightly) argues, everyone typically assumes that a few principle actions are responsible for 80% of possible improvement.</p>
<p>Optimal control tends to focus on these big things, which are also usually particularly thorny optimizations. Most of the classic textbook hard optimization problems could have come right from the UPS case: the traveling salesman, the inventory packing/set cover problems, and so forth. Impossible to solve exactly on large networks, approximate dynamic programming approaches have since been the work-around. Yet the “Big Data” approach takes a rather different strategy all together, tackling many small problems instead of one big one. Our typical approach of theoretical abstractions to simple models is designed to focus on these big overarching problems. In abstracting the problem, we focus on the big picture stuff that should matter most – stuff like figuring out the optimal route to travel, and so forth. But when the gains through increasing optimization of these things are marginal, focusing on the “other 20%” can make more sense. However, that means abandoning the abstraction and going back to the original messy problem. It means knowing about all the other little levers and switches we can control. In the UPS context, this means thinking about how many times a truck backs up, or idles at a stop light, or what hand the deliveryman holds the pen in. Given both the data and the ability to control so many of these little things, optimizing each one in the first place can be more valuable than focusing on the big abstract optimizations.</p>
<p>So, does this work only once the heuristic solutions to the big problems are nearly optimal, so improved approximations have very limited gains? Or can this also be a route forward when the big problems are primarily intractable as well? The former certainly seems the more likely, but if the latter is true, it could prove very interesting.</p>
<p>So this got me thinking – if we accept the latter premise we find a case closely analogous to the very messy optimizations we face in conservation decision-making. Could the many little levers be an alternative? It’s unlikely given both the need for the kind of arbitrarily detailed data at almost no cost available to the UPS problem, and also the kind of totalitarian control UPS can apply to control all the little levers, while the conservation problem more frequently has nothing bit a scrawny blunt stick to toggle in the first place. Nevertheless, it’s hard to know what possible gains we have already excluded when we focus only on the big abstractions and the controls relevant to them. Could conservation decision-making think more outside the box about the many little things we might be able to more effectively influence?</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-collaborating-with-markdown-dynamic-document-workflow">Some thoughts on collaborating with markdown / dynamic document workflow</h2>
<p>Collaborating on manuscripts with other researchers when not writing in MS Word has been a perpetual nuisance for those of us not using Word (no doubt the others might say the same). When I first began writing papers I worked in LaTeX, and at that time I collaborated largely with others who already knew TeX (e.g. my mentors), so this wasn’t much of a problem. While moving my workflow into markdown has simplified collaborations with (often junior) researchers who know markdown better than tex, it has managed to make the potential for mismatches even greater, as it creates a barrier for both co-authors working in LaTeX as well as those working in Word.</p>
<p>This has always been more of a nuisance than a real problem. I’ve usually just sent co-authors some derived copy (e.g. a pdf, or sometimes creating a Word or TeX document from the markdown using pandoc and sending that). This means I have to transcribe or at least copy and paste the edits, though that’s never all that time consuming a process.</p>
<p>I still have high hopes that RStudio’s <code>rmarkdown</code> format will make it practical for co-authors to edit and compile my <code>.Rmd</code> files directly. Meanwhile, a mentor who frequently uses LaTeX in collaborating with Word users suggested a much simpler solution that has proven very pratical for me so far.</p>
<h3 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h3>
<p>Based on his suggestion, I just paste the contents of the <code>.Rmd</code> file into a Word (well, LibreOffice) document and send that. Most collaborators can just ignore the code blocks and LaTeX equations, etc, and edit the text directly. I send the compiled pdf as well for the figures and rendered equations. A collaborator cannot easily re-compile their changes, but I can by copy-pasting back into the <code>.Rmd</code> file. They can track changes via Word, and I can track the same changes through the version control when I paste their changes back in. It’s not perfect, but it’s simple.</p>

<h2 id="transparent-figures">transparent figures</h2>
<p>I use semi-transparent graphs to show ensemble distributions of stochastic trajectories. First, a quick example as to why:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(sims_data) +
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_line</span>(<span class="kw">aes</span>(time, fishstock, <span class="dt">group=</span><span class="kw">interaction</span>(reps,method), <span class="dt">color=</span>method), <span class="dt">alpha=</span><span class="fl">0.1</span>) +
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">scale_colour_manual</span>(<span class="dt">values=</span>colorkey, <span class="dt">guide =</span> <span class="kw">guide_legend</span>(<span class="dt">override.aes =</span> <span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dt">alpha =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>))) +

<figure>
<img src="http://io.carlboettiger.info/nonparametric-bayes/replicates.svg" />
</figure>
<p>Statistical summaries can get around this approach, but don’t really reflect the true rather binary nature of the ensemble (that some trajectories go to zero while others remain around a constant level):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(sims_data) +

<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">stat_summary</span>(<span class="kw">aes</span>(time, fishstock), <span class="dt">fun.data =</span> <span class="st">&quot;mean_sdl&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">geom=</span><span class="st">&quot;ribbon&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">fill=</span><span class="st">&#39;grey80&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">col=</span><span class="st">&#39;grey80&#39;</span>) +

<p>Tweaking the statistical definitions can remove the more obvious errors from this, but still give the wrong impression:</p>

<h3 id="technical-challenges-in-submitting-transparent-figures">Technical challenges in submitting transparent figures</h3>
<p>All this works great with R+ggplot2, generating svg versions shown here or in generating pdfs for the final manuscript. Try and upload those pdfs to manuscriptcentral though (or arXiv, actually) and they will render improperly or not at all. What ever happened to the “portable” in “portable document format”? (Note that submission systems can take EPS/PS, though we’d need to change our LaTeX flavor for it, but R’s graphic devices for those formats don’t seem to support transparency.</p>
<p>It seems the problem for pdfs arises from different versions (thanks to Rich FitzJohn for figuring this out, I would never have managed). Transparency is natively supported in pdf &gt;= 1.4, while in earlier versions it is just emulated. R can generate pdfs in 1.3 (using <code>dev.args = list(version=&quot;1.3&quot;)</code> as the knitr chunk option), but unfortunately, ggplot promotes pdfs to version 1.4:</p>
<pre><code>Saving 7 x 6.99 in image
Warning message:
In grid.Call.graphics(L_lines, x$x, x$y, index, x$arrow) :
  increasing the PDF version to 1.4</code></pre>
<p>I’m not quite clear what part of the ggplot command triggers this, as some ggplot figures do render in version 1.3. To add one more gotcha, RStudio’s <code>rmarkdown</code> by default runs pdfcrop which also promotes the pdfs to version 1.4.</p>
<p>It seems that pdf 1.5 works however – opening the v1.4 pdf in inkscape and saving as v1.5 seems to do the trick. (the current R version seems to be 1.7, though R supports up to 1.4). This is the route I took for the time being with mansucriptcentral, though frustrating that it requires a step external to the <code>rmarkdown::render</code> process.</p>
<p>They can also take TIFF for graphics (though (pdf)LaTeX can’t). I suppose one could submit jpg/png images as supplementary files for the tex compilation, which would have been a workable solution if annoying to use rasters when a vector graphic is preferred (and much smaller – I can’t understand why manuscriptcentral takes 10^4 times as long to upload a document as arXiv or other platforms).</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Used some down-time while traveling to hammer out a long overdue update to my <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations">knitcitations</a> package.</p>
<p>My first task inovled a backwards-compatible update fixing a few minor issues (see <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a>) and providing pandoc style inline citations <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/releases/tag/v0.6-2"><code>v0.6-2</code></a>, on CRAN.</p>
<p>I followed this with a ground-up rewrite, as I summarize in NEWS:</p>
<h2 id="v1.0-1">v1.0-1</h2>
<p>This version is a ground-up rewrite of knitcitations, providing a more powerful interface while also streamlining the back end, mostly by relying more on external libraries for knitty gritty. While an effort has been made to preserve the most common uses, some lesser-used functions or function arguments have been significantly altered or removed. Bug reports greatly appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>citet</code>/<code>citep</code> now accept more options. In addition to the four previously supported options (DOI, URL, bibentry or bibkey (of a previously cited work)), these now accept a plain text query (used in a CrossRef Search), or a path to a PDF file (which attempts metadata extraction).</p></li>
<li><p>Citation key generation is now handled internally, and cannot be configured just by providing a named argument to <code>citet</code>/<code>citep</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>cite</code> function is replaced by <code>bib_metadata</code>. This function takes any argument to <code>citet</code>/<code>citep</code> as before (including the new arguments), see docs.</p></li>
<li><p>Linked inline citations now use the configuration: <code>cite_options(style=&quot;markdown&quot;, hyperlink=&quot;to.doc&quot;)</code> provides a link to the DOI or URL of the document, using markdown format.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for cito and tooltip have been removed. These may be restored at a later date. (The earlier implementation did not appropriately abstract the use of these features from the style/formatting of printing the citation, making generalization hard.</p></li>
<li><p><code>bibliography</code> now includes CSL support directly for entries with a DOI using the <code>style=</code> argument. No need to provide a CSL file itself, just the name of the journal (or rather, the name of the corresponding csl file: full journal name, all lower case, spaces as dashes). See https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/issues/38</p></li>
<li><p><code>bibliography</code> formatting has otherwise been completely rewritten, and no longer uses <code>print_markdown</code>, <code>print_html</code>, and <code>print_rdfa</code> methods. rdfa is no longer available, and other formats are controlled through <code>cite_options</code>. For formal publication pandoc mode is recommended instead of <code>bibliography</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This version was developed on a separate branch (<code>v1</code>), and has only just been merged back into master. CRAN doesn’t like getting multiple updates in the same month or so, but hopefully waiting a bit longer will give users and I a chance to shake out bugs anway. Meanwhile grab it from github with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">devtools::<span class="kw">install_github</span>(<span class="st">&quot;cboettig/knitcitations@v1&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>You can see this package in use, for instance, in providing dynamic citations for my <code>RNeXML</code> <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/blob/7a6be7bd0106bc91a5586ee614b3cf5249627692/manuscripts/manuscript.Rmd">mansucript draft</a>.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Ben Bolker has an excellent post on this complex issue over <a href="http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/guest-post-is-statistical-software-harmful">at Dynamic Ecology</a>, which got me thinking about writing my own thoughts on the topic in reply.</p>
<hr />
<p>Google recently announced that it will be making it’s own self-driving cars, rather than modifying those of others. <a href="http://www.automotive.com/news/1405-google-envisions-self-driving-cars-with-no-steering-wheel/">Cars that won’t have steering wheels and pedals</a>. Just a button that says “stop.” What does this tell us about the future of user-friendly complex statistical software?</p>
<p>Ben quotes prominent statisticians voicing fears that echo common concerns about self-driving cars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Gelman attributes to Brad Efron the idea that “recommending that scientists use Bayes’ theorem is like giving the neighbourhood kids the key to your F-16″.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it is particularly interesting and instructive that the quote Gelman attributes to Efron is about a mathematical theorem rather than about software (e.g. Bayes Theorem, not WinBUGS). Even relatively simple statistical concepts like <span class="math">\(p\)</span> values can cause plenty of confusion, statistical package or no. The concerns are not unique to software, so the solutions cannot come through limiting access to software.</p>
<p>I am very wary of the suggestion that we should address concerns of appropriate application by raising barriers to access. Those arguments have been made about knowledge of all forms, from access to publications, to raw data, to things as basic as education and democratic voting.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons for not creating a statistical software implementation of a new method, but I argue here that fear of misuse just is not one of them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>The barriers created by not having a convenient software implementation are not an appropriate filter to keep out people who can miss-interpret or miss-use the software. As you know, a fundamentally different skillset is required to program a published algorithm (say, MCMC), than to correctly interpret the statistical consequences.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>We must be wary of a different kind of statistical machismo, in which we use the ability to implement a method by one’s self as a proxy for interpreting it correctly.</p>
<p>1a) One immediate corollary of (1) is that: <em>Like it or not, someone is going to build a method that is “easy to use”, e.g. remove the programming barriers.</em></p>
<p>1b) The second corollary is that: <em>individuals with excellent understanding of the proper interpretation / statistics will frequently make mistakes in the computational implementation.</em></p>
<p>Both mistakes will happen. And both are much more formidable problems in the complex methodology of today than when computer was a job description.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? I think we should abandon the <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/what-is-correctness-for-statistical-software/">false dichotomy between “usability” and “correctness.”</a>. Just because software that is easy to use is easy to misuse, does not imply that decreasing usability increases correctness. I think that is a dangerous fallacy.</p>
<p>A software implementation should aim first to remove the programming barriers rather than statistical knowledge barriers. Best practices such as modularity and documentation should make it easy for users and developers to understand and build upon it. I agree with Ben that software error messages are poor teachers. I agree that a tool cannot be foolproof, no tool ever has been.</p>
<p>Someone does not misuse a piece of software merely because they do not understand it. Misuse comes from mistakenly thinking you understand it. The premise that most researchers will use something they do not understand just because it is easy to use is distasteful.</p>
<p>Kevin Slavin gives <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world">a fantastic Ted talk</a> on the ubiquitous role of algorithms in today’s world. His conclusion is neither one of panacea or doom, but rather that we seek to understand and characterize them, learn their strengths and weaknesses like a naturalist studies a new species.</p>
<p>More widespread adoption of software such as BUGS &amp; relatives has indeed increased the amount of misuse and false conclusions. But it has also dramatically increased awareness of issues ranging from computational aspects peculiar to particular implementations to general understanding and discourse about Bayesian methods. Like Kevin, I don’t think we can escape the algorithms, but I do think we can learn to understand and live with them.</p>
